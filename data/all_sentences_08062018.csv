"The Florida machine broke down in 13 months, in the middle of a print job, and NOTHING on it would work anymore - the scanner, the fax, NOTHING works when the ""Print Head Error"" appears.",299
"Canon CANNOT repair it, they tell you that out of the kindness of their heart, they will SELL YOU a REPLACEMENT -- at a price higher than you find on Amazon (which price includes free shipping).",300
"You will be happy when your machine gets there and then REALLY MAD when it inevitably fails and you find yourself with a 35 pound doorstop.",301
"There are a lot of machines out there better than this for the same or less money- do yourself an act of kindness and purchase one of those OTHER MACHINES and leave these dogs lying in Canon's warehouse somewhere.",302

"Great printer, works very well. - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) Seriously...it's a printer.",304
"It scans very nice, although the additional software is a bit much.",305
"I don't really need it to open every time I turn on my computer.",306
"However, it is fast, quiet and doesn't seem to use that much ink.",307
"To be fair, I use my Canon photo printer if I'm doing prints.",308
"This is more for contract and scanning documents for work.",309
"I have had no issues setting it up on my home network.",310
"It's not very hard, although the instructions in the 'online' manual are a bit lean.",311
"It is very good quality and works well.",312
"I am sold on canon.",313
"The CD printing is a bit complicated - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) This is a great printer, very nice color and image quality, the set up and wi fi capabilities are up there, I got it because is able to print CDs, it does, however, is a bit tricky to learn to do this, once you get it is not a big deal, but is slow while printing CDS.",314
"also, the software to design the Cd cover is very limited and not friendly, dont get me wrong, is a high quality unit and works pretty much as advertised, the scanner works also very nicely",315
"great printer - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) I was overwhelmed with trying to set it up, but it turned out to be much easier than I thought!",316
"It is very easy to use.",317
"Replaces my old HP which I will never use THAT brand again.",318
"Have an old Pixma which still works well, but this one does more.",319
"Great price, and you can get an extended warranty with it.",320
"Beats other brands on plain paper only in high quality mode, best choice anyway based on print quality - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) Just bought this one tonight.",321
"Tested against the Canon MG5420 and against the Epson 810 and HP 8600 using plain inkjet paper (not multipurpose copy paper).",322
"Now that I've got it home, can't wait to try some photos and a printable DVD.",323
"I reset each printer to factory defaults and ran them through a head alignment.",324
"The print quality for all three was markedly different in style.",325
"All were pretty good, but weren't as good as my old HP Photosmart had been when it was brand new.",326
"Printers, like everything else, are being engineered junkier and junkier as they drive down price and add gee-whiz features.",327
"In standard mode, the MG5420 and MX922 both suffer notably from banding on solid-colored fields.",328
"I'm astonished that Canon management allows this to go on, there must be a fix.",329
"If you switch from standard to high quality mode, the banding is gone, completely.",330
"Print quality is nearly flawless.",331
"Is it using much more ink, or just moving the print head and carriage more slowly?",332
"This was the best print of all the printers in regular and high quality mode, and both Canon prints looked the same.",333
"The HP 8600 had minor, less noticeable banding, but also had some weird squiggly thing going on so that the images had faint jagged lines through them that reminded me of a TV picture scrambled by a ham or CB radio.",334
"The Epson has the smoothest and most uniform print.",335
"It looked flawlessly uniform, but also slightly hazy and dull.",336
"The Epson had the best picture for uniformity by far.",337
"If only its colors popped like the Canon, or if the Canon could figure out how to deposit the ink more uniformly.",338
"The Epson also has cheap price per page.",339
"The 5420 took ...f.o.r.e.v.e.r...",340
"to start printing.",341
"You would hear it make some noise, thinking maybe it was about to start, but it would grind on and on and on, and I was convinced it was pumping massive quantities of ink into the waste ink reservoir.",342
"It was depressing.",343
"The 922 uses the same ink cartridges so must share some parts in common, yet it started printing right away.",344
"It's poised as a lite business class printer and nobody's going to tolerate waiting so long for their print in a business environment.",345
"But after printing, it's grinding away too, probably wasting ink.",346
"Jesus.",347
"Overall, I wanted to get the Epson and tolerate the dull colors because of the amazing uniformity in standard mode, and the cheap prints.",348
"And I liked the HP for the sturdiness and excellent control panel.",349
"But my spouse vetoed them both.",350
"She liked the Canon prints the best because of the color, contrast and sharpness, and preferred the 922 because the 5420 was so slow.",351
"In high quality mode, its plain paper prints are the best.",352
"Did not do any testing on photo paper.",353
"Both the 5420 and 922 are subjectively rattlely and not rugged compared to the Epson and HP, plus they both have flimsy and awkward control buttons compared to the Epson and HP controls, which are touch screen units.",354
"But they're older models.",355
"I didn't check the other printers' power connections, but this one takes an AC cord, no annoying brick or wall wart.",356
"Wifi setup was really easy, it gave me a list of access points, I picked my router and entered in the WPA2 key using the buttons.",357
"It came with a CD for the driver, I can't for the life of me figure out why these printers don't serve up their own driver automatically, the way the printers at work hosted by print servers do.",358
"Is it 2013 or not?",359
"The MX922 belongs at a sub-$120 price point in my book.",360
"We got it for a steal because the brick and mortar store price-matches items shipped and sold by Amazon, and Amazon is giving these things away today on Cyber Monday.",361
"But we'd have grudgingly paid $150 for it over the other two brands which were in the $130 range, and the super-cheap but excruciatingly slow $50 MG5420.",362
"Canon printer - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) Like the printer, prints great 4x6 photos and like the easy wireless setup.",363
"Uses a lot of ink but I try to keep spare ink around.",364
"very disappointing - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) I had a Canon Pixma Pro 9000 that work flawlessly until it suddenly died.",365
"So I replaced it with this printer.",366
"We were all excited, especially my wife so that she didn't have to walk all the way to my office, plug the usb cord to print.",367
"It work as a charm for a few days.",368
"And now the wireless function gives an error 6901.",369
"It says Cancel Printing but there is NOWHERE on the printer where you can do that.",370
"There no manual also.",371
"We turned it off, unplugged it, turned off the wi-fi but without any results.",372
"We went back to the ""old fashion corded way"" and it prints.",373
"The other thing I don't like is that it takes 5 good mn to get ready, so we just leave it on all the time.",374
"I hate to waste electricity but I also hate to wait those 5mn.",375
"I don't recommend this printer",376
"Love it!",377
"- Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) I love the quality of the Canon Photo printer.",378

"Great product otherwise and amazingly clear photos.",380
"I must say I LOVE the fact that I can print from my phone, ipad, flash drive, you name it!",381
"LOVE that feature!",382
"I'd actually give this a 4 3/4 if possible.",383
"Good printer, software issues - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) As is typical with Canon, print quality is good, but software support is lacking.",384
"There are multiple issues, some of which were fixed in latest firmware upgrade.",385
"Installing all OC the canon utilities is kind of annoying, as it comes with way too many software features.",386
"Alas, there is no scan software for Win 7 document scanning.",387
"Pros No setup for iPad & iPhone AirPrint compatible Windows XP support for quick scan utility Scan to USB, fast & high quality Duplex printing Wifi (WPS one touch setup works great) Great packaging, easy lift handles to remove from box Large paper tray Cons 1-2 minutes to start printing first page after coming out of standby No scan utility for Win 7 PCs, need to download your own scanning software!!!",388
"iPad/iPhone printing often selects manual feed tray, requires reset to fix Ink is used VERY quickly Wifi printing large files up to 5min /page No wifi status, always shows blue even if its not working Scanner jams easily Overall, a good printer.",389
"I hope than Canon works to improve the software support though.",390

"But some free paper was included.",402
"Fun software.",403
"It is pretty loud but has a sound adjustment.",404
"How cool is that.",405
"I wonder why they didn't just make it sound lower in the first place.",406
"I was impressed that the software installed on both XP and Win 7.",407
"I printed out a few photos and they were nice.",408
"I gave it a 4 because I have only had it for 2 days.",409
"The paper manual that they provide is just a get started page, that worked for me but some people might need more instruction.",410
"Once the software is installed there is a basic menu and I printed a couple of pages, like how the fax paper goes in and the regular paper and photo loads.",411
"I get forgetful sometimes.",412
"The software comes with some creative software.",413
"Lay out and print photos.",414

"When turning it on it makes all sorts of clicks, turning sounds, unlike my previous Canon Pixma.",424
"I don't know if it's supposed to do that but it's pretty noisy and takes about 10 minutes to be ready to print.",425
"When sending to print it seems slow to spool in wifi mode, but printing is pretty fast.",426
"I haven't tried connecting directly to the computer.",427
"In standard mode print quality seems pretty clean so far.",428

"Since my kids never remember to turn off the printer, this will be a frequent occurrence.",485
"Turning my router off and on is NOT a solution as I don't want to wait an extra 3 or 4 minutes for my network to come back up, in addition to the 2-3 minutes the printer takes just to warm up and then another 2-3 minutes for it to prepare itself to print.",486

"And there is no visible help on the forums.",595
"Lots of questions but no answers from Canon.",596
"I guess they're praying we users will do their job and find a fix.",597
"Users are beginning to realize that the products are crap.",598
"About the same time I got my printer I also got a new ASSIS gateway (modem and router in one) from my ISP, Xfinity.",599
"I spent hours and hours trying to straighten out connection and slowness problems.",600
"On Xfinity's forums a bunch of other people had problems and finally a user found out that the encryption settings they tell you to use don't work with their equipment.",601
"You can only get consistent connection if you lower the encryption standard.",602
"Again it's the users who found the work-around, not the technical service.",603

"I'm checking into return policies because I don't think there is a fix.",605
"Terrible Printer - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) This is by far the noisiest and slowest printer I've ever used.",606
"It is not at all intuitive and no manual is included, just a quick start guide.",607
"It went through ink like crazy and of course the OEM cartridges are expensive as with most printers.",608
"One of the cables actually frayed and no one seemed to be able to fix it.",609
"Luckily, I had bought a Square Trade Warranty and am sending it to them tomorrow for a full refund.",610
"Do yourself a favor and avoid this printer, don't let the lower price sway your decision.",611
"I've usually had good luck with Canon products, this was an exception.",612
"Good quality output but drops wireless a LOT. - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) I got this as a replacement for an 880 which was taking longer and longer to prepare itself for each print job (minutes, sometimes).",613
"It also did not have the ability to print from an iphone or ipad without a $50 add-on.",614
"For $50, I figured it was time to upgrade to a newer version.",615
"I've had this printer a couple of months now and the print quality and speed is good, but only after I have to reconfigure the wireless nearly every time...and in my setup it sits alongside the router, which means it's not hard to reset, but a hassle when trying to print and finding out there is no printer on the network.",616
"The rest of the functions are great -- same as all Canon Multi-function units (I've had at least 4 and given some to others too), but having to reset the wireless so often is a pain.",617
"It does power up quickly and prints color and greyscale quickly.",618
"The auto feed function is terrific, especially for scanning.",619
"Quality for color photo printing is decent enough.",620
"Comparing to the 880, I do NOT like the fact that the lid to the interior access (where the ink cartridges are) is just beneath the lid to the flat copy/scan bed.",621
"If your output ""flap"" is open (becomes output tray for copies at the front center of the unit) when you reach to raise the lid of the unit to access the copy bed, you will instead grab the access panel for the interior of the copier.",622
"If the output tray is closed, that is covered and its a non-issue, but if you are making copies or scanning via the flat bed it is *very* frustrating and I've been tempted to tape it shut.",623
"But that's a small issue.",624
"The bigger issue is the frequent dropping of the wireless signal, which is far worse than my old 880.",625
"Inks are expensive, but they all are.",626
"I recommend looking at the XL cartridges, which at least mean you don't have to change as often.",627
"The only problem is that when one cartridge is out, the entire printer won't work -- so if you are in a bind and just want to print a greyscale copy in a hurry, you are out of luck if your yellow or magenta cartridge is out.",628
"I've been a loyal Canon multifunction printer customer for many years, through at least 5 different models, but given the dropping wireless issue I would not recommend this unless you are planning to use it as a wired printer or don't mind resetting the wireless every day.",629
"Flimsy construction - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) I am very disappointed with how flimsy the plastic construction is on this printer.",630
"I had a MX700 for many years and absolutely loved it.",631
"This one, not.",632
"It will work for me for now, but I don't see it lasting like my previous Canon printer.",633
"Cons: Two paper trays, read carefully.",634
"There is only one paper tray that accepts 8.5x11.",635
"The second tray is for printing small size photos or directly onto CD/DVDs.",636
"And the trays are very flimsy.",637
"Software is a pain.",638
"I'm not stupid yet you are forced (as most products are doing today) to use their stupids picture icons that take up your screen to get to what you want to do.",639

"Again, why can mfg just make a product without getting into the software business.",642
"I have thousands of dollars investing in software, I know how to use a computer.",643
"The only good this obnoxious software is for, is for people who don't have an understanding of what they are doing.",644
"Very 'smart phone' and 'windows 8' platform styled.",645
"Pros: It automatically prints a multi-page document and collates it.",646

"Throws ink away with constant cleaning - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) The printer is excellent as far as black text printing is concerned.",648
"Almost laser quality.",649
"Photo printing is as good as it gets, but with a bit less accuracy (blues and greens) compared to my previous MP640 photo printer.",650
"Maybe a bias, since it is not a photo printer but rather an office machine?",651
"Multifunction process does all it promises.",652
"The only grunt is that the software is consumer oriented and IMHO inferior to MP640.",653

"I contacted Canon support and they directed me to the local representative.",662
"They verified cleaning uses ink from all cartridges and instructed me not to switch off the printer, even when I will not use it for days, since the printer will clean every time it is switched on.",663
"In vain, since the printer will clean anyway.",664
"I had pixmas since the very early series and despite the fact the all used to have 1 pl print head, they did not do such constant and time consuming cleaning.",665
"And they were never clogged either.",666
"And standard cartridges were 11 to 14 ml, instead of 7ml (pay 50% premium for XL if you want 11ml).",667
"All that, before MP640.",668
"Hoped that MP925 was better.",669

"On a time, rather than usage basis.",672
"Way too slow - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) Despite the many good features of this printer, it is painfully slow to print the first page after it has gone into sleep mode.",673

"The printer is hardwired to a computer upstairs and works great.",730
"But about half the time, the printer drops wireless print tasks from the laptop downstairs even though we are only 30 feet away at the most.",731
"And on the occasions when it gets the print job it sometimes will not print it for 24 hours - you think it did not get the job and then unexpectedly it prints it 7 or 14 or 24 hours later.",732

"At some point I am going to replace it.",734
"You get what you pay for.",735
"High quality but hard to use - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) The printer has a lot of good features, but the menu is not user-friendly.",736
"In particular, scanning is much harder to do than on my old HP printer because there is no indication of where to find the scanned file or how to print it.",737

"Somewhat disappointed.",770
"But for the price I will consider it a throw away",771
"Not as good as expected - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) This is a very robust printer and despite the reviews informing that it prints fast, they never said the printer takes forever to starts printing.",772
"Also, the wi-fi option never works, even after you follow all the manual procedures.",773

"You have to go through 3 or 4 choices or operations to do a simple task.",782
"This also results in it often jamming at one point of the process.",783

"It's not worth the trouble.",787
"My old printer and fax worked much better.",788
"NOISY & SLOW - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) First, I did not purchase from Amazon, because I found another source on eBay, with free shipping, no sales tax and matched Amazon's price.",789
"Having said that, I selected the printer because I was in the market for a wireless printer and this model seemed to have the most positive reviews.",790
"I gave this printer only three stars because of the issues during set-up and the so-called customer support.",791
"Here is the 411: My experience with the set up was a chore.",792
"To be specific: Out of the box the set up was pretty easy until I attempted to set up the wireless connection- what a nightmare!",793
"Apparently my router, Linksys WRT400N, does not have a WPS button, so I contacted Canon and Linksys customer support and ended up with call center reps in India both times.",794
"Here is where it gets interesting (I mean suspicious).",795
"Both reps seemed to be working from a script because the conversations were very chatty, like I was their new BFF, and very similar.",796
"I explained the problem I was having and they said they could help me but needed to 'get control' of my computer, which I gave them.",797
"After they started going through all my files and then found many that were supposedly 'infected' which was why I could not set up the wireless connection.",798
"O-kaay what do 'we' do to fix this?",799
"The answer was to turn me over to a 'Microsoft rep' who offered various packages from $150 to $500 to clean up all this malware, Trojan horses etc.",800
"Very interesting, right?",801
"I am relating this to warn you folks who have a similar problem not to be taken in by these scammers.",802
"After sleeping on the issue for a night, I made another attempt using my laptop (which is the primary reason I purchased a wireless printer).",803
"Well, to make a very long story much shorter I went through the wireless set-up process again; this time using the 'other' option because the printer couldn't locate the WPS button (probably because this router does not have such a button-DUH!).",804
"VOILA!",805
"Instant connection.",806
"I printed a document, and although somewhat slow and noisy, out came a pristine page.",807
"Success!",808
"My wife was sitting across our desk with her IPad, and had similar success.",809

"Mike",819
"So far so good - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) It prints very well, and the online capabilities are pretty impressive.",820
"My main use is for school work so when it comes to picture printing qualities i really don't care.",821
"I gave a four star because the unit is bigger than i though.",822
"In my opinion Canon should have made a little more compact.",823
"But it's sleek design makes up for the bulkness, it is not such an eye sore.",824
"Just okay. - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) We bought this as a replacement for our workhorse PIXMA MX830 all-in-one which was starting to die after 7.5 years of service.",825
"I wanted to buy the exact same thing, basically, and was hoping this 922 would be it.",826
"Not so much.",827
"It was easy to install on our Airport wifi and works nicely with our Macs .",828
"But it only has one 8.5x11 paper tray instead of two.",829
"And it's a lot noisier, which I can live with easily if it weren't for how much churning and thinking and whirring it does before printing most documents.",830
"Simple, one page .docs and .pdfs.",831
"The quality is nice though.",832
"And it didn't come with a cable connecting it to the computer, which is necessary for scanning unless you enjoy transferring it via the USB flash memory port all the time.",833
"Haven't tried faxing yet, but I went through setup and heard the dial tone, so I assume that will be simple enough.",834
"photo print quality - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) Photo print quality is not good that I expected and too big size,noisy Basic printing quality is fine :) !",835
"Tragic Design Flaws - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) Having had enough of printer drivers and flaky network printers, I ordered the MX922 for its cloud printing capabilities, which turns out to be capability (singular).",836
"Google Cloud Print is awesome and simple to set up, all my cloud printing dreams have been realized; unfortunately 'copy' and 'scan' functions are kept entirely distinct from the useful flexibility of cloud printing.",837
"Perhaps it's fair that 'copy' auto-prints, much like a photocopier, but in the end 'copy' is simply 'scan' with fewer features.",838
"Sadly disappointing, 'scan' allows one only to scan to a local computer (NET/USB/WiFi) or a USB thumb drive via a port fashionably surrounded by plastic preventing most thumb drives from connecting.",839
"The little ADATA Superior Series S102 Pro thumb drives fits nicely but anything larger will need a USB extension cable to work around this silly design flaw.",840
"If I may print to the cloud, why mayn't I copy/scan to the same cloud?",841
"Apparently Canon have decided that 'scan' can't print because that's 'copy', and 'copy' can't use cloud printing because it must work like thirty year old photocopiers.",842
"In the end, the Canon PIXMA MX922 works well with Google Cloud Print but offers no other significant innovations, including ones which seem rather obvious.",843
"Wifi setup still painful - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) It's hard to understand how the setup of a wifi device can still be so hard.",844

"AirPrint Compatible (C11CC33201) - it didn't, but it came close.",850
"It's certainly superior to any consumer or mid business grade HP - and doesn't have the ridiculous bloatware and requirements for calibration, etc. that the Epson has.",851
"Pros: - Stellar photo quality printing.",852
"It was definitely better than similarly printed Sam's Club photos, but at a much higher cost of paper and ink, obviously.",853
"I'd sacrifice the quality for the better price. - Super easy setup.",854
"It found my Wifi quickly, using the integrated screen.",855
"No messing with wires or one-time setup.",856
"It just worked.",857
"Same with the iPad - found it quickly and could print from there without an issue. - It prints quality documents of every type, both in color and black and white. - Compared to the Epson, the interface is much easier to use and more modern.",858
"Cons: - Would be nice to have a rear feed.",859
"The Epson has this and it's very nice for envelopes, one-offs, etc. - The software isn't nearly as user friendly as the Epson software.",860
"From scanning to printing, I prefer the Epson, mostly due to the fuller feature set of the scanning software.",861
"It brings up all options immediately, as opposed to the Canon which gives a bunch of screens to scroll through. - Not all trays handle all paper.",862
"I found the photo tray almost annoying, as I simply don't print that many photos to dedicate an entire tray.",863
"The Epson only has one tray but it is very large, and it has a rear feed.",864
"Overall, this is an excellent printer but not up to the level of the Epson, UNLESS you need to print photos.",865
"If so, I'd recommend the Canon.",866

"Jams are easy to clear.",874
"The ADF is why I bought this printer and it has helped me tremendously to archive old documents, before I destroy them.",875
"Wireless does not stay connected - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) I think when the printer prints, the quality is great.",876
"Careful how you put the photo paper in.",877
"The photo side goes down, not up.",878
"One of the reasons I was drawn to this printer is because of its wireless capability.",879
"Once I set it up I tested it and it worked great.",880
"It connects to your wireless network and any device on that network can print.",881
"However, the wireless does not stay connected.",882
"I had to reset it each time I go to print.",883
"I finally went out and bought a cable that I could connect to my desktop so I had a solid connection.",884
"I may have missed something or some option is not chosen, but the wireless has not worked as designed.",885
"Not great, but good enough - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) Yes, it's big and noisy.",886
"It's also cheap and fully loaded.",887
"Duplex printing.",888
"Sheet fed and flat bed scanning.",889
"Wifi.",890
"Apple Airprint support.",891
"Sometimes it prints without a startup delay, but than afterwards it just keeps grinding away making noise.",892
"I was going to return this as four days in a row it couldn't print from Wifi until rerunning the setup on the printer.",893
"For some reason the printer wasn't remembering the settings from the WPS setup.",894
"Manually configuring the wireless settings prevented the issue, and stopped me from having to return the printer.",895
"I did not install the Image Garden app, and downloaded the full drivers from Canon's website.",896
"To scan, I press the scan button on the printer, and select the destination computer from the printers screen.",897
"Easy enough.",898
"Easier than the Canon Pixma this printer replaced.",899
"The previous printer's print head failed after 3 years.",900
"Considering what both printers cost (this one as a Deal of the Day), I'll be happy if I get 3 years out of the new one.",901
"And just as with the previous printer, I fully intend to refill or use knockoff printer cartridges (which I verified were available before purchasing the printer).",902
"I keep saying my next printer will be laser, and than I wind up buying another ink jet anyhow.",903
"Anyone need Ink for the MP830?... - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) ...because I have two complete Canon ink refills left over for my old printer.",904
"This new one, the MX922, is a bit of a disappointment compared to the MP830.",905
"The software interface is not as flexible with regard to scanning a document, in that the user cannot specify, during the scanning process, exactly where, what format, how many DPI, etc, a document may be saved.",906
"You have to specify those attributes in a different place, prior to scanning.",907
"Also, I would prefer to have the ability to print an envelope from a different tray, rather than having to remove all the current paper from the cartridge, set it up for envelope, return it to the printer, then print the envelope.",908
"That's fine if you're printing many envelopes, but I mostly print them one at a time, so it is easier, with this printer, to just address them by hand, with a pen, something I never did while I owned the MP830.",909
"So, overall, it has the same features as the MP830, but doesn't seem to be any faster, doesn't seem any easier, and certainly not any more envelope-friendlier than the 830.",910
"The only thing really cool about this printer is its wireless networking ability.",911
"It was easily installed on the network, and the airprint option for the iPhones is awesome!",912
"No additional ap required.",913
"Seriously, if you need Canon CLI-8 or PGI-5BK ink, I have two complete sets.",914
"Post or Email me with your best offer, i'll send them to you.",915
"Sigh.",916
"NOT an easy set up. - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) First off, let me say I hope to come back tomorrow and update both my stars and my rating, but for right now, I am tired and frustrated.",917
"I just got my printer today, and was very excited.",918
"Now, after 2 hours, it is still not set up, and I am going to have to give it up until tomorrow when I can call tech support.",919
"Why is it that people who write instructions assume you know what an ""access point"" is?",920
"or a ""WPS button""?",921
"So here's my string of problems (so far): 1.",922
"Removed all the packing papers I could find, but didn't realize I was also supposed to remove the little orange piece of plastic that was in one compartment, so spent 15-20 minutes trying to figure out why I kept getting an error message that told me to remove packing material under the document cover.",923
"I had removed the tape, but thought the little orange thing was part of the printer.",924
"It wasn't. 2.",925
"Couldn't figure out why paper wouldn't fit in the tray.",926
"OK, I admit to feeling really stupid about this one, but I could not see that there were two trays at the bottom.",927
"This one cost me 20 minutes as well, and I almost packed the thing up in disgust to send it back!",928
"3.",929
"Unable to connect to my home network.",930
"After digging around on the internet, we decided that our router has a button marked ""QSS"" and that is the same thing as a ""WPS"" button.",931
"So husband held the button, I poked the OK button on the printer and after 3 minutes we gave it up.",932
"Now back at the beginning of the set up it did say to put the printer near the ""access point"" - I am guessing now that meant the router - but we need the printer to be in another room, next to my computer, not next to the router.",933
"My computer is running on our wireless network just fine, so that should be close enough.",934
"I hope we don't have to haul the printer into the other room just to connect to our wireless network!!",935
"4.",936
"Manual?",937
"Now this is something that really bugs me...there isn't one.",938
"And I haven't found one on-line yet.",939
"So I wait til tomorrow to see if the phone tech can help....sigh.",940
"Very Nice Printer - Works Great - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) We are very pleased with this AIO.",941
"It replaced an Epson that just had too many paper jams.",942
"Quality is good, prints fast and we have yet to have a jam.",943
"The only drawback is that the LCD display is pretty basic.",944

"The 922 is kind of a divergence from the feature rich MX series of the past (such as the 560, 870, and 892) Gone is the bypass tray in the back - so no card stock, no business card stock, etc.",955
"The manual seems to avoid the words ""card stock"" so you cant find out for sure until you read the limitations on paper thickness (paper over 28# is not recommended).",956
"Gone are all the nifty flash card options, you need to put your card into a USB card reader then you plug that in.",957
"New is the CD tray where you can print on printable CDs. (some might like that addition)",958

"Has wireless, wired and bluetooth connections supports cloud print if you portable device supports it.",961
"Has cheap 3rd party ink.",962
"Otherwise, like previous printers, it has lots of usability print/fax/copy/scan.",963

"And what do you know...",977
"it actually WORKS!",978
"Had it 6 months now and after years of frustration I can finally get something to print when I want it without having to troubleshoot issues.",979

"But it is very annoying in that it often takes a lot of time to do it's maintenance.",994
"For instance, I just printed an envelope.",995
"When I hit the print button the printer starts whirring and clacking and clicking doing who knows what.",996
"It whirred and clicked for 83 seconds, then took 3 seconds to print the envelope.",997
"While it doesn't do this every time you print something, it does it often enough to annoy you, and of course it does it most of the time when you are in more of a hurry.",998
"The printer also uses a lot of ink.",999
"The last negative is that it doesn't have a separate paper tray for envelopes.",1000
"You have to take the paper out of the tray, adjust the tray slides and put the envelopes in, do your printing and then put the paper back in the tray for normal printing.",1001

"Warm-up and printing are fast, faster than my previous Canon printers.",1007
"The price of $156 plus tax, including a double ink supply, was reasonable.",1008
"Installation was straight forward.",1009
"I installed the MX922 wirelessly, and it works without problems with my Windows desktop, 2 Windows netbooks and an Apple iPad.",1010
"My earlier trials of wireless installation with the MX870 failed, so I am happy with the MX922 as a wireless printer.",1011

"Not only does it look great, but works great as well.",1040
"Wireless printing works flawlessly, although there are a couple of hiccups with that.",1041
"First, I cannot connect the printer with the easy ""press the WPS button"" setup on the router/cable modem from Comcast, I have to actually enter the network key - which is no big deal, but it would have been nice to be able to do that.",1042
"Second, I've noticed that the printer doesn't print when it's in sleep mode - that is if I send a print job to it while it's in sleep mode nothing comes out and I get the notification on my computer that the printer is not connected.",1043
"But if I make sure the printer is on before I print, no problems.",1044
"Only other issue is that if we haven't used it to print for a few days it will take a VERY long time to print the first page (my guess is that it knows it wasn't being used and is cleaning out the printer head before it prints, whereas the Kodak used to just immediately print a horrible copy - I actually had to print two or three copies of something to get anything useful with the Kodak - so I don't mind this at all - I would rather it take a little bit of time to print something good the first time instead of having to print multiple copies to get something useful).",1045

"Love my old MX860 - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) So much that I got this for my girlfriend and it is every bit as awesome as the 860...yes it is slow on the print...but it does so much, from duplex scanning to PDF to awesome photo printing...hey kick your feet up and relax...it does it all wirelessly and set up is a breeze..sure it is big but so is my work copier and it is WAY bigger (yes way faster) but this does all that and with cheap replacement cartridges on Amazon.",1047

"I had to have my son in law make a couple choices with the Wireless set up.",1065
"But we were able to get it going without using the supplied CD.",1066

"I should say that I usually use Photoshop Elements 5 to do my scanning with, so maybe that was why I had to install the CD.",1068
"But I suspect the printer needed the updated driver for the grayscale option to show up.",1069
"Print quality: Is very high.",1070
"I was able to print some beautiful photos borderless at 8.5x11"" for visiting relatives.",1071
"Two Issues: (1) As other reviewers have pointed out, it is noisy, especially on startup and at times when feeding paper, clunky sounding.",1072

"When I was printing another 8.5x11"" color photo, this one at standard quality, I placed a Canon sheet of Photo Paper Plus Glossy II in the printer with regular printer paper.",1081
"The design of the paper cassettes/trays and feeding path is such that you must place the side you want to print on facing down, that is in contact with any other paper in the cassette/tray.",1082
"So the glossy side of the photo paper came into contact with the regular printer paper.",1083
"Consequently when the printer fed the paper in for printing, it took two sheets, instead of only the photo paper sheet, and printed mainly on the regular printer paper, not the photo paper.",1084
"Thus wasting a considerable amount of ink.",1085
"It worked fine when I removed the regular printer paper and placed only one sheet of the glossy paper into the cassette/tray.",1086

"Problems started with the installation.",1176
"For some reason, the print drivers would not install.",1177

"I find it to be very slow sometimes, depending upon what I'm printing (and it almost seems like depending upon what mood its in!).",1447
"Also, having to fold up the paper receiving tray in order to get to the paper loading tray is somewhat of a pain since I print a lot of two sided items.",1448
"All in all, I would buy it again and it certainly beats any HP I've had...and I've had a lot of them!",1449
"Prints fine when it can be found by WiFi processors. - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) The printer does print, however the Air Print or printing over WiFi is difficult to manage.",1450

"The WiFi function is difficult to set up and does not maintain its presence on my home network.",1452

"produces good photo quality prints, but as always for canon, longevity is the key issue... - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) Amazon usually has great deals on Canon printers, and the MX922 is probably the fourth photo quality Canon printer I have bought at Amazon in the last few years.",1459
"I needed a printer with the ability to produce good quality 8.5""x11"" prints, and like the previous Pixma class printers I have owned, the MX922 does a very nice job with photos, documents, and webpages.",1460
"While the ink never lasts as long as I would like, the MX922 usually produces colors that are accurate, and the prints have a decent amount of detail.",1461
"For $90 as a Deal of the Day, the MX922 was a good buy, but I hope that this printer is more durable than my previous Pixma printers, which although lightly used, mysteriously died for no apparent reason after lasting just over a year.",1462
"It seems that every time I get a new printer, Canon has developed a new type of ink cartridge, so I can't use my old supply of ink.",1463
"The cost of genuine Canon ink cartridges is exorbitant, so it's cool that there are some non-OEM cartridges available, but the bad thing is the substitutes for the MX922 cost a lot more than the previous generation of generics I used to buy.",1464
"I use Canon photo paper, and get good results with both the matte (50 sheets) and the glossy (100 sheets) finishes.",1465
"The matte paper absorbs more ink, so you can probably save ink using glossy paper.",1466

"If you plan to connect via USB, be advised no USB cord is included.",1468

"When printing, if the output door isn't open, it will drop down automatically.",1471
"There are two paper trays, the lower one is for 8.5x11, and the up for specialized media.",1472
"They feel kind of flimsy, so I would exercise care when inserting a tray.",1473
"The MX922 does a decent job of scanning and copying, and is a fairly good value as an ""all around"" printer.",1474

"The printer is noisier than the other one and takes quite a bit longer to warm up (both at turning it on and sending something to it to print), and the pages are printer slower than my old one (even though it said it was faster ppm).",1486
"I had issue with Duplex printing and got several pages stuck...haven't retried it since.",1487

"I kept getting some looping error message about needing to load the paper tray.",1498
"Paper was in the tray.",1499
"Each time I restarted the printer to clear the error, the machine took more than 5 minutes to calm down before I could try printing again -- only to fail again.",1500
"I gave up and tried printing from the by-pass or whatever other tray was available (I can't remember now), but then I started getting wireless network errors.",1501

"The printer does include a download for a pdf instruction manual but as is the usual case for these things, it is full of pages more appropriate for a real manual i.e. blank pages except for a title.",1704
"I had a bit of trouble completing the set up and ended up calling the 800 number.",1705
"Customer service was great and I soon had the printer up and working.",1706
"Next problem was trying to figure out how to print envelopes and photos.",1707
"I did manage that without additional help but it's tricky.",1708
"Overall this printer performs well and only received 3 stars because of the operating manual.",1709
"Slow starter, but otherwise ok - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) I bought this printer to use in my office.",1710
"I don't print constantly- just occasionally.",1711
"For that reason, I was excited about the wifi feature- I can stash the printer across the room and not have cords everywhere.",1712
"The wifi connectivity works as advertised- I've successfully scanned and printed documents over the wireless connection.",1713
"My big complaint about this printer is that it takes a very long time to produce the first page.",1714
"It seems that if I haven't used the printer for little while, it has to go through a very long head alignment process or something so that it can begin printing.",1715
"This literally adds MINUTES to the printing process.",1716
"If you don't think that will annoy you, I'd urge you to reconsider- this is, in my mind, a serious flaw on an otherwise OK device.",1717
"The advertised speed (21 PPM) is not achievable unless you're printing a massive document.",1718
"That first page is going to be a snoozer, I promise.",1719
"We love this!",1720
"- Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) We wanted a reasonably priced wireless printer and scanner.",1721

"Other reviewers have said that it is slow.",1724
"I think if you print large amounts of paper I could see the frustration.",1725
"We never print that much at a time so that hasn't been an issue for us.",1726
"Love that we can print from our iPhones and iPad.",1727
"One design flaw cuts the rating to four star. - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) It is a great printer except for one feature, which I consider a mistake in their upgrade from the MX822.",1728
"I frequently send the same letter to many individuals.",1729
"With the envelope using the rear tray and the letter using the front tray it was a simple process to address the letter, print the envelope and letter.",1730
"Then change the address and repeat the process.",1731
"With the 922 they put the envelope and the letter both in the front lower tray.",1732
"This means taking the paper out to print the envelope then putting the paper back in to print the letter.",1733
"This is a very cumbersome process and is the reason for the four star rating.",1734
"Too noisy and inconvenient - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) This model is too noisy; my previous Canon PXMA 870 was quiterier.",1735
"Also, I don't like to have to remove the letter size paper to address the accompanying envelope; my previous Canon printer had a rear paper tray which I used for envelopes.",1736
"This I thought was much more user-friendly.",1737
"Otherwise the quality of the results are fine.",1738
"Awesome Deal.....Thank You Amazon for Black Friday Price - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) Printer setup was extremely EASY....",1739

"Side-by-Side Comparison ...",1753
"Canon MX892 vs the latest MX922 - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) Get the slightly older MX892.",1754
"The MX922 is like Windows Vista..",1755
"it is like an overhaul model that needs an immediate overhaul.",1756
"I did a side by side comparison of the MX892 & MX922.",1757
"I highly prefer the MX892 that is a few months older than the latest MX922.",1758
"The MX922 has slightly bigger ink cartridges, can hold more paper in the bottom tray, is slightly less deep, has the same width, but is slightly taller.",1759
"Also, the exiting paper tray is obtrusively a lot wider.",1760
"The MX922 claims to have a 15ppm vs the MX892's 12.5ppm.",1761
"That is one of the reasons I thought it would be better.",1762
"In all my repeated tests..",1763
"the MX892 proved to be faster.",1764
"It printed single pages in 15.1 seconds, and the MX922 did them in 18.3 seconds.",1765
"The MX892 is notably much quieter.",1766
"The MX922 is loud.",1767
"The ink cartridges on the new MX922 have been redesigned to be positioned way up front, and not underneath the scanner (like that of the MX892).",1768
"That is why it is louder..",1769
"they are not buried as deep into the machine.",1770
"Although, such design does allow for a slightly easier change of the ink cartridges, it is at the high cost of a much louder printer.",1771
"The MX892's cartridges are not at all hard to change (Canon didn't need to overhaul it - lol).",1772
"It requires one extra step (lifting the scanner portion).",1773
"A final thing is that the print quality on the MX892 is notably smoother, and pops more (both under grayscale setting, both under 'fast print' setting).",1774
"The MX892 makes more crisp and slightly darker prints.",1775
"Side Note: A huge reason I prefer Canon over other manufacturers is because you can easily default-save 'grayscale & fast printing' under their software setting (that is constantly saved).",1776
"This saves ink (other companies use software that has the color printing locked by default, so you use more color ink, or you have to manually switch out of color printing for each black & white print).",1777
"Please click 'yes' if this was helpful to you.",1778
"Just another average printer - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) Just another so so printer that eats cartridges somewhat quickly.",1779
"At least the cartridges are cheaper than HP's rip-off prices.",1780
"To me the color print outs are much closer to what I am seeing on my screen than any HP printer I've owned.",1781
"I am not printing photos with it only graphic images.",1782
"so annoying - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) I have bought several Canon printers because they use individual ink cartridges.",1783
"If the 2011 tsunami hadn't impacted their ability to supply a new printhead I wouldn't have replaced my old one at all.",1784
"It was a little workhorse.",1785
"This printer is one of those which rolls the paper up from the bottom tray.",1786
"A roller takes it out of the bottom tray at the back and prints on the side that was face down.",1787
"That means you can NEVER print mailing labels because as they go over the roller the edge of the label will lift up and instant paper jam!",1788
"Now and forever.",1789
"And when you lift the lid, the opening to get the paper out is so small, there's no way to clean the roller of the glue if you had to.",1790
"If you only intend to print a single piece of paper at a time, it might not drive you crazy but as a home office printer, it was absurd.",1791
"So glad Amazon quick refund and replacement didn't cost me more days.",1792
"A very good multifunctional printer - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) The printer arrived on time.",1793
"Setting it up for Wi-Fi printing was very easy.",1794
"It takes a while to warm up before printing, but I hope Canon will shorten the warm up time in the future.",1795
"It has lots of features that I'm currently not using but overall, it does what I bought it to do very well.",1796
"Don't buy this model!",1797
"- Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) This is the second PIXMA MX922 we've had.",1798

"The second PIXMA MX922 won't fax either.",1801
"We spent many a hour with Tech Support trying to get it to fax.",1802
"They were puzzled and didn't know what else to do.",1803
"That says a lot about this printer.",1804
"No matter what we try, this machine will not fax period!",1805
"It also uses a lot of ink.",1806
"It is too late to send this printer back.",1807
"The next one will not be a Canon. .",1808
"Huge and takes forever to warm up - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) Though it takes about 5 minutes to wake up, warm up and then finally print, once its going its good.",1809
"Also love the automatic 2-sided printing and scanning.",1810
"One drawback: its freaking huge!",1811
"Something like 1.5' x 2' x 1' Not suitable for a typical desk in a bedroom but if you've got a home office you should be able to find room for it.",1812
"Defective product - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) Printer would not set up.",1813
"Many hours expended to no avail.",1814
"Finally got thru to live body who after frustrating effort indicated the print head was defective.",1815
"How did that get thru their inspection efforts?",1816
"Why was there no recall?",1817
"Offered to send replacement but was instructed in method to remove and replace print head.",1818
"Why must I be asked to perform repairs on a new purchase?",1819
"Was asked to package up non-working machine and take over to UPS for return.",1820
"Am 82 years old.",1821
"I don't need this.",1822
"Some flaws but still a very good all-in-one - Canon Office Products MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) The Canon MX922 can both print and scan wirelessly, a big plus for me.",1823
"And the wireless setup is very, very easy.",1824
"In addition to fast wireless printing from my PC, it also prints wirelessly from my iPad Mini.",1825
"The MX922 is also a very beautifully designed machine.",1826
"I was using a MX860, which I thought printed beautiful color photos until I printed out the same photo on that machine and on my new MX922.",1827
"The MX922 printed significantly richer colors.",1828
"I do have some complaints though they are not serious enough to make me wish I had not purchased the MX922.",1829
"First, the LCD is not a touch screen, which seems a bit bit archaic at this point, especially compared to competitors' comparable AIOs.",1830
"My other complaints are the lack of a rear paper tray and the annoying process of loading legal size paper.",1831
"Unlike the MX860, which allowed you load both legal size paper AND envelopes easily into the rear tray and letter size paper into the lower/bottom tray, the MX922 only has two lower trays.",1832
"The upper of those two trays only accepts photo paper.",1833
"The lower tray accepts envelopes, letter size paper, and legal size paper.",1834
"Adjusting that bottom tray for legal size paper is both annoying and a bit bizarre.",1835
"I often feel like the somewhat flimsily constructed bottom tray will break while making that adjustment (which involves having to take the tray completely out of the machine and push the bottom of the tray on a button-like indentation that then lets you more fully extend the tray before you have to reinsert it).",1836
"Thus, if you have to print a legal size document, a letter size cover letter, and an envelope, you will have to first put letter sized paper in the bottom tray, print out your cover letter, pull out the tray, take out the stack of letter size paper in the tray, make the aforementioned bizarre adjustment to the tray, insert legal size paper into the tray, print out your legal sized document, take the bottom tray out again, reverse the adjustment for legal size paper, adjust the tray for envelopes, print out the envelope, pull out the bottom tray yet again, adjust the tray for letter size paper, insert letter size paper, and finally once again insert the bottom tray back into the machine.",1837
"For paralegals, legal secretaries, real estate secretaries, and others who need to print out both legal and letter size documents, plus envelopes, this will be an annoying process.",1838
"Common sense does not seem to have been a priority in the design of this machine.",1839
"The MX860 was much, much better designed for such a process.",1840
"Great for home - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) I'm a fan of Canon PIXMA printers.",1841
"Installation and connection to my network was very easy.",1842
"It came with the FAX function set to pick up on 2 rings so every time someone called me the fax tone started and the people had to hang up.",1843
"No problems on outgoing calls.",1844
"I eventually figured out how to correct this by setting my rings to 6 times before picking up.",1845
"I'm disappointed in the printing from smartphone function.",1846
"After setup you need to send an attached file to an email address that winds up printing.",1847
"It doesn't print the actual email message body.....just the attachment and then there's a size limit.",1848
"It's kind of slow preparing to print but once it starts it is printing at what I consider normal speed.",1849
"Other PIXMA printers I've had have ink cartridges that were clear so you could physically see just how much ink was left.",1850
"This one uses a cartridge that doesn't allow you to view the actual ink.",1851
"It's fine for what I use it for and so I'm happy with my choice but it definitely is no speed demon.",1852
"Canon Printer - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) So far this printer seems to handle everything I want it to do.",1853
"The only problem is that it is pretty bulky and takes up a large amount of space.",1854
"more of the same - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) I'm having the same issue as JC.",1855
"Can't get the print head to align.",1856
"I'm caught in an endless loop of ""Head alignment required...press OK"" -> ""Auto head align has failed.",1857
"Select OK and repeat"".",1858
"Apparently there should be an option to manually align but I can't access that menu feature while caught in the endless loop.",1859

"Time to go back to HP.",1865
"A nice ""Disposable"" printer - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) I'd recommend the PIXMA MX452 at half the price.",1866
"You get 95% of the printer at half the price.",1867
"If you use your printer every couple days most of your ink is used up in cleaning the printer heads during the warmup cycle.",1868
"Well this printer cleans the printer heads really well.",1869
"Not user friendly - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) It's a great machine, but just like most Canon products they are not very user friendly.",1870
"For example I had a problem printing pictures from the Canon program....",1871
"Instead I simply used my IPhoto program on my Mac.",1872
"Printing Powerhouse - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) I haven't yet tested every feature of my PIXMA MX922, but so far, after several months of medium use, I am quite pleased.",1873
"I work from home, for a non profit, and I don't have to print all that often.",1874
"However, when I do, my materials need to be professional looking.",1875
"I have yet to find something disappointing in this printer.",1876
"I've used it to scan, print and copy, wirelessly without fail.",1877
"There are so many additional features that I haven't even used yet, but look forward to testing out as I need them.",1878
"I'm pleased with the printing speed, the quality and to be honest, I even love that the paper try door opens automatically for me.",1879
"I still smile when I watch it open from across the room.",1880
"The first time I printed without opening the door first, I realized that I hadn't opened it, and raced over to open it so that it wouldn't jam, as I expected it might.",1881
"At a minimum I expected the print job to be stalled.",1882
"I was wrong.",1883
"After a little over two months of use, I had to recently replace the black, magenta and cyan ink cartridges.",1884
"The process was easy enough, and based on the way I seem to use ink, I opted to replace the inks with the XXL Black, and XL magenta and cyan colors.",1885
"My hope is that I won't be replacing them so frequently going forward.",1886
"Of course, I bought the printer knowing I could replace the inks individually, which was a priority for me.",1887
"The only trouble I had at all with the printer thus far was upon initial set up with the slightly less intuitive keypad while hooking it up wirelessly.",1888
"I wound up calling customer service, embarrassed, for some help, and the customer service rep was incredibly helpful and even told me that she also thought the keypad wasn't as intuitive as it could have been, and that's what she was there for.",1889
"Normally I find initial tech set up pretty straightforward and easy, but for that I was confused.",1890
"After being on the phone less than 10 minutes, I had a much better understanding of how the keypad worked, and I was extremely pleased with Canon's customer service.",1891
"New, but NOT Improved - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) Had the Canon MX850 for years and was very happy with it up until the day it died.",1892
"It seemed a no-brainer to order this model, with the built in wireless function (Older model required a separate bridge.)Unfortunately, this machine is terribly slow and noisy.",1893
"There's no such thing as getting a ""quick copy.""",1894
"By the time the machine thinks about what you ask it to do and starts to do it, you could have done 10 things on the old machine.",1895
"It is also annoying that the ink cartridges are similar, but not identical, so unused, unopened ink is useless when it's time to ""upgrade.""",1896
"Now I wish I had spent time and money on repairing the old printer, but I was advised against it and know that it's usually cost-prohibitive with these electronic products.",1897

"It is a fine machine.",1914
"Let's put the negative attributes first.",1915
"There are few and insignificant but worthy of dropping my score by one point.",1916

"It is in no way a deal breaker for me, however.",1918
"*I use Canon ink without a question and have no known reason to change.",1919
"While somewhat costly, it works well and lasts longer than the cheaper knockoffs.",1920
"*The large cassette paper holder requires a fully stocked or loaded tray in order for it to feed the paper for printing.",1921
"I tried every configuration I could think of to get it to print from one or two sheets to above the maximum allowable sheets.",1922
"Only a full tray would permit papers to be fed for printing.",1923
"If a print job required, say, 100 sheets I might have a concern; however, it is seldom that I need more than 10 sheets at a time so the problem of paper jamming or not processing because of cassette size is no problem for me.",1924
"I will be contacting Canon to see if there may be a fix or if the cassette is defective.",1925
"Time does not permit that just yet.",1926
"*That's it.",1927
"I could not find any other negatives.",1928
"The positives far out number the negatives and are more meaningful. ?It is wireless and that is a game winner for me.",1929
"I can sit in the TV room and use a netbook, laptop or tablet and when I need to print something it is simple Control P and in a few seconds I can get my output from the other side of the house.",1930
"Additionally, the setup was easy for not only the wireless applications but the entire process.",1931
"That alone is important to me especially since there are so many chances for failure but not one occurred. ?Many of folks do not use fax or scan including me but it is there available for that one critical need when it comes.",1932
"It's like a car with 8 valves.",1933
"Many of us seldom need that much power but when it is needed it's there.",1934
"Those features work well as does the copy feature.",1935
"While I often need a memory boaster to remember which side should go up or down when performing these jobs I prepared a simple sticker that reminds me ""original up"" to assist. ?The quality of the output is typical Canon: fantastic.",1936
"I really like the photo quality and it is especially great if the proper glossy paper is used. ?This printer has two paper trays that Canon calls cassettes.",1937
"The smaller tray is for smaller sized prints and, I really liked this one, a place for making a label for computer discs such as a CD or DVD label.",1938
"Now I can print a quality, readable label which is far better than my scribbling with a marking pen.",1939
"The little drawer holds 4X6, 5X7 and up to 7X8 sized paper.",1940
"Turn the tray over and there before your very eyes is the CD slot for use in making a worthy CD label.",1941
"The larger tray handles 8.5X11 and 8.5Z14 legal papers as well as the old standard U.S. government size.",1942
"The adjusting sizars make it easier to fit the perfect paper into the tray regardless of the paper's size.",1943
"(I might have located the reason for the paper jamming or not working properly.",1944
"There is a single post to hold the paper before it released for the printer to print instead of having two posts such as the smaller tray has.",1945

"This is pure speculation on my part because I am no where close to being an engineer or the like.",1947
"The other components of that particular area are symmetrical except for the single post.",1948

"Or given me any problems!!",1970
"And it's got the ""Quick Start"" feature, which means it starts and turns off really fast.",1971
"LOVE that thing!",1972
"So, this one also has the quick start, but does make quite a few noises when you first turn it on (not too bad though).",1973
"It has duplex printing, which is the only thing I'm missing on my old model, as this is pretty essential.",1974
"If you don't have the duplex feature, you can always flip the sheets over to print on the backsides, but if you've got multiple sheets, it can become a hassle.",1975
"I did use the duplex feature on this, and it kept folding the lower left corner of the paper, or crinkling that same corner of the paper.",1976

"I called Canon about this, and I received one within a few days.",1983

"I've been using it for a week now and still don't understand why it is so noisy in printing.",1992
"It thrashes away and grinds before it prints, then more thrashing about while printing,then, after you have recovered from all the loud noise, it suddenly does more post-printing thrashing about!",1993
"The MX850 had no such theatrics and was not noisy.",1994
"The other problem encountered was the hours spent trying to get my remote laptop hooked up to the printer, an exercise that was relatively simple with the MX850.",1995
"I eventually succeeded with the help of Netgear.",1996
"The other negative is the lack of paper documentation.",1997
"I know it is the modern trend, but it is still a pain going online to what is now a fancy layout centered on ""My image garden"".",1998
"Again, unlike the MX850, nothing seems intuitive and what used to be easy-to-find instructions for activities that were non-standard are now hard to find .",1999
"I have been a long-time fan of Canon products but this geek-inspired machine has me doubting that time improves products.",2000

"Much better to share your printer on a network or plug it into a printer USB connection on your router.",2015
"Clearly hardware companies have a much harder time understanding the user experience than software companies.",2016
"That's the iPhone lesson: make your products less feature-driven and more user-driven.",2017
"Another major flaw is the fax mode, which doesn't work too well, especially if your phone provider is an ISP: this printer seems to have been built for land lines of yore, not today's modern telephony networks.",2018

"I don't have any complaints.",2048

"it does take a while to start up and shut down but for $99 it's pretty incredible.",2083
"Also I printed business cards on 210 gm/m2 paper which worked well - according to the manual and online this would not have worked but I'm 1 for 1 using this non standard heavy stock.",2084
"Canon tech support is noteworthy - probably the best of any tech company - definitely in the upper tier.",2085
"Hope to not need them but I it did lock up on me once.",2086
"Had to unplug it for a while which made me worry but I'd recommend it anyway",2087

"This is bad idea Canon.",2096
"Please fix.",2097
"works well but - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) Maybe it is just this unit or the cable from the computer to the printer or something but it gives me fits at times, not connecting to the printer when I try to print.",2098
"The other thing I REALLY don't like is that you can't print thick books.",2099

"It's the first printer I've ever seen that doesn't have a back tray, and it's seems ridiculous not to have such an easily accessible way to load different size papers.",2113
"Instead, there are 2 bottom trays on the front to hold either paper (though only letter size) or envelopes (though not the standard #10 size).",2114
"This is only helpful is you don't swap out paper often, or need to print legal or business envelops, then it is a huge pain to deal with.",2115
"The paper tray also has to be adjusted a couple of different ways, each time you swap between legal and letter size paper (which I do a couple times a day).",2116
"The adjuster has already broke a little bit, so it's even more of a pain for me.",2117
"Also, all paper must be put in upside down, because the paper flips inside the printer before it prints.",2118
"Not a big deal, unless you're printing checks or anything in a specific order.",2119
"Then everything must be manually sorted before printing, or your projects is doomed.",2120
"This new Canon is also a bit louder than it's predecessor (the MX982).",2121

"Overall, I LOVED the previous model (MX892) so much that I bought two (thankfully one still works perfectly).",2123

"It then just stopped working over the network and would only work as a USB printer.",2130
"Since it had no Ethernet port and I had nowhere to set it up as a USB printer I was forced to replace it.",2131
"When I set up the Canon printer I found I had the same problem with it, it wouldn't print over the wireless connection.",2132
"I did a lot of troubleshooting and am now convinced that it is a problem with my router.",2133

"After printing a few documents and photos I can say it has very good print quality.",2139
"I have seen better but only on much more expensive printers, it definitely blows away the HP I am replacing.",2140
"It was easy to set up, though a bit time consuming.",2141
"The instructions that were included were easy to follow and connecting wirelessly was very simple, though it didn't work in my case.",2142
"I haven't had this long enough to comment on how long the ink cartridges last but they seem to be lasting longer than the cartridges in my old HP (I had to replace the cartridges in that every couple of months no matter how much or how little I printed).",2143
"I won't knock down the rating because of the wireless issue because as stated I am completely sure it is an issue with my router.",2144

"I still stand by my statement that the instructions in the box and on the web are useless.",2250
"BUT, Canon does have GREAT phone support!",2251
"Reminds me of the great Apple phone support!",2252
"The two Canon phone reps that turned it around for me were Chris who walked me thru connecting to my wireless network and Dave who walked me thru scanning and duplex copying.",2253
"Then, somewhere on the Internet I found these instructions which have kept my Canon from dropping off my local wireless network: (1)Go to Menu>>Setup>>Device Settings>>Lan Settings>>Other Settings>>TCP/IP Settings>>IPv6 Choose No 2)Go to Menu>>Setup>>Device Settings>>Lan Settings>>Other Settings>>Wireless LAN DRX Setting Choose Disable.",2254

"Works Great - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) This was a replacement for a MX850.",2256
"It does everything the 850 does and more.",2257
"Cons: Slow on powering up.",2258
"Printing seems slow.",2259
"It is noisy.",2260
"It seems to be made cheaper as opposed to the 850.",2261

"Easy to setup & connection is a snap.",2263
"Canon-Fire Strikes Deep - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) Amazing printer.",2264
"I never expected some of the features, including the disc printing option, easy network printing, and the power of Google Cloud Print.",2265
"The only thing to be desired is faster print speed (hence the four stars); however, this is by far the fastest Canon printer I have ever owned.",2266
"Excellent - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) It's a bit bulky, as you can see, but it's quite cool looking and super easy to install and use.",2267

"Multiple formats.",2276
"Great wireless system used for 4 computers spread out thru the house.",2277
"A bit tough to navigate in the menu system, but after a few tries, you figure it ou.",2278
"Printer goes offline quite a bit, ink drains way too fast. - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) It prints pretty well, but dang is it noisy.",2279
"It has a quiet setting which will decrease speed, but I don't see why the quiet setting wasn't the primary mode for it in the first place.",2280
"It disconnects every now and again from the wifi, so that's kind of cumbersome.",2281
"I've probably printed about 100 pages, yet my PGBK color is nearly exhausted.",2282
"Keep in mind, these 100 pages are double-spaced papers, and they probably only fill half a page.",2283
"Ink for canon printers are extremely expensive, and I've had bad experiences with third party products, so I definitely am disappointed there.",2284
"Photos that are printed come out looking very nice though.",2285
"It captures contrast well and colors don't get flat.",2286
"They pretty much look similar to how it is on my display.",2287
"So that's a big plus.",2288
"I'm somewhat happy with the product, though I think I could have found something better.",2289
"It's got quite a few issues that I think years of printing experience would solve.",2290
"Oh well.",2291
"Replacing Pixma 892 printer - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) OK, so after ca.",2292
"year-and-a-half of exemplary service, our Pixma MX892 Printer flashed up the DREADED error code B200.",2293
"And we went through all of the ""fixes"" suggested on tons of on-line forums, but - nada...couldn't print, but eventually could access outgoing FAX and SCAN functions.",2294
"Nice, but - you know - it's a PRINTER!",2295
"So, I'm going for the MX922 as a service substitute, because you can't beat the price - way cheaper than trying to rehab the MX892.",2296
"The way to look at these Canon printers is: buy as cheaply as you can find, wait till the thing flames out on you, then buy a replacement unit.",2297
"I wish I could say that the printers have the same quality as Canon cameras...but, NO, these printers are just basically throwaway units, topping up landfills across the planet.",2298
"Anybody who has owned Canon printers has eventually found him-/herself Googling, ""What's up with error code B200, already?"".",2299
"And one will find all sorts of stuff about cleaning printheads, replacing printheads, replacing ink cartridges, etc, etc.",2300
"Fuggedabouddit, that won't work!",2301
"I am convinced that somewhere in the firmware a clock is running that sooner or later will say: ""Time's up, sulkka, it's over for ya!""",2302

"But, in it's favour, I must say that I love the GUI, the software is so much better than HP, but at the end of the day, I've got an old HP 1500 AIO that's still operating, after 15years, fa' God's sake, and we will be starting on our second PIXMA in less than two years.",2304

"I do wish it had more instructions with it but it does have instructions on line and the person from Canon was very helpful and polite.",2310
"This is one great machine.",2311
"Awesome printer, etc - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) Bought one for myself & then one for my mama.",2312
"Only problem is no manual.",2313
"And, you can't download from Canon's site in a PDF.",2314
"However, most tasks are fairly intuitive, so there's that.",2315
"picky and sceptical - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) Ok, I've owned a dell all in one printer for several years and it still works, but was never quite satisfied with all of its features.",2316
"So I decided to finally update my printer to get more modern features.",2317
"So far I am very satisfied with this printer.",2318
"Photo print feature is awesome, looks very professional.",2319
"There are features in which I have yet to explore, but from what I have observed thus far, it is a good printer.",2320
"The reason I have given it four Stars is because the wireless set up was very complicated.",2321
"Prior to purchasing this printer, I purchased an epson, and the wireless set up was a breeze.",2322
"But the canon is a much better built printer hands down.",2323
"I also like the two sided printing feature.",2324
"It is also one of the top rated inkjet printers in consumer reporters.",2325
"I will update my review as I use more features",2326
"Very good printer for personal and home office use - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) Works as advertised.",2327
"A bit slow to begin when printing wirelessly - even on gigabit network.",2328
"Else it's worth the price.",2329
"Looks nice too.",2330
"Meets my needs - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) After researching dozens of printers, this one fits my needs.",2331
"I needed a a wifi printer, large paper capacity and separate ink cartridges, and this one did all that.",2332
"I do agree with comments concerning no touch screen.",2333
"This ability would have given my review another star.",2334
"All in all.",2335
"It still a good printer for the money.",2336
"too slow - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) worst printer i ever had honestly and ive had alot of canon products...its always processing something or warming up even when u just printed something out...id stay away from this one",2337
"Great for our office, not as much for photography. - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) I purchased this printer to be a dual use between my husbands contracting company and my photography business.",2338

"Definitely a great printer for the money.",2342
"I would buy it again.",2343
"took me time - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) I have a Chromebook and it took me some time to figure how to connect the cloud printer to my device, and still have some days when printing is not that easy but once I get it to work it is just fine.",2344
"Canon has eliminated the User Manual formerly enclosed with the Printer and their Customer Service Can be Clueless - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) The MX922 produces high quality text and pictures and faxes nicely (with a good multipage feeder for fax input and copy input).Canon like some other technology companies has decided to put the user manual on-line rather than print it.",2345
"I noticed that Panasonic still prints the user manual for its wireless telephones.",2346
"Being on-line, the Canon manual makes it hard to find instructions on how to do things like two-sided copies and fax reports.",2347
"If you have a problem during the one-year warranty and Canon technical service cannot fix it over the phone, you have the choice of taking it to a service center (which may be a long-ride away) and leaving it or requesting a replacement be sent to you.I had a replacement (refurbished printer) sent to me.",2348
"Although the MX922 printers are sold with the printhead already installed, Canon sends the printhead in an envelope enclosed with the replacement printer.",2349
"This printhead is impossible to install without detailed instructions and they are not sent to you.",2350
"If you can call Canon technical service when they are open, they can talk you through this difficult process.",2351
"I was trying to do this on a weekend when Canon technical service was closed, and I could not do it and had to return the replacement printer, but fortunately I was able on my second try to fix the original printer myself.",2352
"I had a problem with paper stuck in the roller which are accessible from the back and bottom of the printer (but it can be hard to get all the paper that got stuck out).",2353
"This is my third Canon printer but probably my last, since Canon is so clueless about how to perform Customer Service.",2354
"Noisy but good - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) I bought this mostly to have a scanner for larger documents.",2355
"As such, it works well, feeding from the doc feeder as well as the platen.",2356
"It is noisy though.",2357
"Also, enveloped are fed after removing the paper from the lower cassette, which is not efficient.",2358
"That was the only thing my old HP did well.",2359
"I don't miss it, though, and am very happy with this Canon.",2360
"The scans are very high quality, too!",2361
"Disappointed - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) I had a Canon prior to purchasing this Canon for the Fax option.",2362
"It is very noisy, slow, too big, and the directions do not explain how to set up the fax.",2363
"Currently, I have it working but in order to do so I have to be without my home telephone service.",2364
"I think I have to purchase an additional jack with four inputs.",2365
"It does not print any better than my older model and the ink runs out quickly.",2366
"Overall, I'm very disappointed. :-(",2367
"Great printer - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) Bought this for the CD/DVD printing function.",2368

"Woo hoo!",2376
"Great All-in-One...",2377
"with a small exception - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) I really do love this printer.",2378
"I bought it in August 2013.",2379
"So it's had a good run here and I feel confident posting a review. :) It is very easy to scan docs and/or items on the flatbed.",2380
"I don't make a ton of copies, but when I do, it's very simple and quick.",2381
"Printing is easy and prints my docs in warp speed.",2382
"(I'm not going to time it, as a matter of 2-3 seconds difference is kind of silly to worry about.)",2383
"It prints from my Mac quickly and the quality is good.",2384
"It doesn't burn through ink like other printers I've had (Epson, HP) and when I do need new ink the replacements are so much cheaper!",2385
"Especially less than the HP!!",2386
"Ink cartridges are very easy to replace and there's a red light that confirms whether you've got the new cartridge fully in place.",2387
"(Not at all necessary, but kind of space age cool nonetheless!) My ONE issue with this printer is that it seems to have something of a mind of its own when it comes to its maintenance schedule.",2388
"My complaint is that sometimes (but not every time) AFTER I print a page...",2389
"The printer will go into some sort of maintenance/supply level check/I-don't-know-what sort of thing where it hums along.",2390
"During this time something-- the ink cartridge carrier, I presume-- is moving around inside and it's very loud.",2391
"That will last about a minute or two and, since I have it right next to the phone in my home office, it can get sort of annoying at times.",2392
"Especially if a call comes in during this mysterious maintenance session.",2393
"Otherwise, GREAT printer/all-in-one!",2394
"I bought it at a reduced rate here on Amazon and have been thrilled with it.",2395
"It's a large printer, but not terribly bigger than any of the others I've had, so that never bothers me.",2396
"It does tend to look dusty a lot, since it's black and shiny normally, but that doesn't bother me, either.",2397
"It prints from my iPhone and my son's iPad pretty easily.",2398
"It also prints decent photos.",2399
"Solid printer that won't soak your wallet for ink replacements!!",2400
"Can't read japanese?",2401
"- Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) Ok, it is a very good wireless multifunction machine.",2402
"But trying to tie it into our wireless network on their instructions and figuring out how to access the instructions on the panel?",2403
"A leap of intuition was necessary.",2404
"The instructions with the printer were worse than useless.",2405
"That being said, we have had it for over six months with no trouble, even printing from ipads.",2406
"Well, I don't even know where should I start.",2407
"Besides the unbearable noise, the printer has some internal problems.",2408
"I set it up in telephone priority mode.",2409
"I get a voice call and while I'm talking, the fax feature hijacks the voice call mid-way.",2410
"It's not that I got a new fax call which hijacked the voice call I'm already on.",2411
"The printer goes into the fax mode midway through the present voice call 'thinking' that the present voice call is a fax call.",2412
"So, the other person who is talking to me, now hears fax static sounds mid-way during the conversation.",2413
"And we have to hang-up.",2414
"This happens for like 9 out of 10 voice calls.",2415
"Canon Customer Service 'guided' me through the set-up process.",2416
"No difference.",2417
"They offer to exchange it and send me a replacement which is a refurbished unit.",2418
"The customer service person said these printers apparently had some tolerance problems with the fax/voice modem at the time of manufacture and so the refurbished units have that tolerance problem sorted out.",2419
"The replacement printer comes and I set it up.",2420
"Well, the same annoying problem of fax feature hijacking the voice call mid-way into the conversation.",2421
"Called Canon again.",2422
"Go through the whole hassle of set up with the canon representative.",2423
"At this point I get really pissed when the guy tells me that I should get a separate fax line for this printer to work properly in my home.",2424
"I had to remind him that the user manual doesn't say anything to that effect.",2425
"I suggested that I be given MX892.",2426
"After a whole lot of struggle with him, he put me to his manager.",2427
"His manager said she was briefed up that I would need a separate fax line for this printer to work in my home.",2428
"I reminded her that the owners manual doesn't say anything to that effect.",2429
"She said, this requirement may be there with some phone providers.",2430
"I reminded her that, even this 'requirement' is not mentioned in the owners manual and I had to tell her that Canon should have included in the specs/owners manual that the fax feature will take over the voice call midway during a conversation with certain phone providers and for such instances the customers should hook up this printer only on a separate fax line.",2431
"She conceded and sent me MX892.",2432
"No more fax hijacking my voice calls mid-way.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Next, the noise that this printer MX922 makes is terrible, even in quiet mode.",2433
"Learn from my mistake and don't buy this flawed printer.",2434
"I never suspected Canon can make such an inferior all-in-one printer.",2435
"MX922 is a huge/giant leap backward from MX892.",2436
"Don't waste your time and peace of mind on MX922.",2437
"Would be glad if Amazon can provide an option of negative stars or zero star rating.",2438
"This printer should never get even one star.",2439
"Period!",2440
"It's ok - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) The printer prints pretty clear but even though it says you can use card stock it will not pick it up from the tray whether there are multiple sheets or just one.",2441
"Returned it because of this although my husband kept his because he just prints and copies on regular bond paper.",2442
"The older models allowed you to print basically anything up to size 8x14 while this does not.",2443
"Good printer after finally setting up - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) I give four stars to this printer, only because of Canon Support, or lack of!",2444
"I set up according to instructions with sheet that came with it, and when I got to the wireless LAN part on printer display it detected my network and said to press the WPS button on my router to unlock the network, which I did, and it connected all right, but it took over my network, renamed it, and then my laptop was no longer connected, had to connect to the new network and when I went to the setup page for router, it was now a Canon Network page, huh!!",2445
"Called Canon and he insisted it would not change my network name or create new one.",2446
"Ended up having to rename network and put in my original password on wired computer (yes, it had even changed this on my router 192.198.1 page), and then do the manual router password on printer.",2447
"That worked easily and connected to correct network.",2448
"Took awhile, but once set up printer works just fine.",2449
"It doesn't vibrate like my old Canon, it prints fast, and pic printed was very nice.",2450
"Text seems crisp and clear, I do hear it, every now and then doing it's checks or whatever, but still seems to print fast enough on network.",2451
"Hoping to try out printing from Android phone in the next few days.",2452
"Overall, I love it so far!",2453
"Very complicated - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) The FAX RECEIVING PART of this machine is very complicated for an average person and I steel can't set it up",2454
"Won't print the color black - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) I paid $150 for this two months ago, but the whole thing is going into the garbage.",2455
"It will NOT print the color black, only medium-dark gray.",2456
"Since I bought it to print booklets and boxed note cards for my small business, this makes it worthless to me.",2457
"Yes, I called Canon and they said that the gray is as good as it gets.",2458
"Yes, I tried lots of fiddling including manually adjusting the intensity and contrast and I could get almost a black color, but that ruined all color printing.",2459
"And yes I tried replacing both black and photo-black cartridges.",2460
"I don't know if it is just this one model or this one printer or if it is impossible to get any Canon printer to print black.",2461
"But I do know that between the printer and the cartridges, I've lost over $200 and I will never risk my money on another Canon product again.",2462
"Works perfect, looks awesome - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) I upgraded recently from the MX 860, which served me well for several years (and still functions fine to this day).",2463
"This thing looks like something from the space program.",2464
"Very sleek and modern.",2465
"It prints and scans noticeably faster than previous models.",2466
"The scan quality seems better, and the print quality is roughly the same as far as I can tell.",2467
"They've also made the unit MUCH easier to connect to a wireless network - no more thumb drive required.",2468
"I only have two complaints - (1) that the multi-function buttons, while they look great, feel cheap and I'm fearful they'll eventually break and (2) the Canon desktop software is quirky and has an outdated interface.",2469
"I had to go to the Canon website to download additional drivers to get it to work and their ""Garden"" product looks like a knock-off PhotoShop from 1996 or something.",2470
"Other than those two issues, it functions flawlessly and looks awesome so far.",2471
"Working Just As It Should - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) I had another printer which was costing me an ""arm & leg"" for the ink.",2472
"I did a lot of research and found this printer where even the Canon ink cost was far less than the competition and I could also use after market ink in the printer.",2473
"I have used after market ink in many printers and seldom have an issue.",2474
"The set up was fairly easy however time consuming and this took the better part of an hour.",2475
"While a DVD comes with the printer, once you insert the DVD into your MAC there is a lengthy download which take place and then the software mist be installed.",2476
"Unpacking the unit, with all the tape, etc on the printer will take a few minutes and I strongly suggest you read the instructions, even if you have installed a dozen printers before.",2477
"The ink cartridges installed quickly.",2478
"You must align the print head and there are instructions for the calibration.",2479
"It just take a few minutes.",2480
"The quality of my prints thus far have been very good.",2481
"I have used Canon's for years and they just keep improving the quality of the printers and especially the quality of the photos.",2482
"I set the printer up using an USB cable which i find suits me just as well.",2483
"Could have used the wireless but seem like that always take me far more time on the is installation.",2484
"There are very minimal materials and instructions in the box however you probably will not need that since you no doubt have had other printers.",2485
"This is a heavy printer weighing in at about 20 pounds.",2486
"I am well pleased with the printer and it's printing this time.",2487
"Canon Printer - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) I bought this printer to replace a Canon printer that I have used for the last four years.",2488
"I use my printer primarily for printing greeting cards and found out that the MX922 printer isn't really good for that.",2489
"It is fine for letters and great for printing photos, but since I wanted it primarily for cards, I had to give it only three stars.",2490
"Border line return item... - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) The printer has a problem that Canon can't fix.",2491
"the printer works fine as longs it is wired into the network.",2492
"All attempts to make the connection a Wireless connection would fail in time and require a reboot of the printer.",2493
"The printer was purchased to add Apple AirPrint to the system, and a lot of time and money was wasted with Apple and others before I found every one had the same problem and the answer was to wire the printer into the network.",2494
"My current opinion in that paying extra to make it work or to extend the warranty is a waste.",2495
"not good - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) After 4 months of light usage it stopped working.",2496
"The service center said that a part broke and it would take a few days to get the replacement part and another few days to repair.",2497
"Will not purchase a Canon printer again.",2498
"Worst printer I've ever owned. - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) I purchased this printer prior to working from home several months after major back surgery.",2499
"I wanted a product with a trustworthy name, multi-function, AirPrint, and Mac compatible.",2500
"I would be printing documents mostly in black and white, and occasional 4x6 pictures.",2501
"So far, every time I want to scan or print items, I have to restart the printer if the printer has not been used within the past 5 minutes.",2502
"This also includes printing from my iPad or iPhone.",2503
"None of my laptops (Windows and Mac), or mobile devices can find the printer on my wireless network.",2504
"Browsing the Canon support site has yielded no answers, and the response from Canon has been terrible (none to date).",2505
"Oh, and after printing 2 pictures (horrible ghosting of the images, bleeding of the colors and washed out looks) and several black and white documents, I'm almost out of yellow ink.",2506

"On Word documents, it sits there warming up about 3 minutes before it prints a simple black and white 1 page letter.",2512
"She then tries to print a PDF document and the command to print goes through, but the printer just sits there.",2513
"This is while being plugged in via USB with updated drivers.",2514
"I promptly threw this in the trash, where it belongs, and put the $40 HP printer back in and everything works fine.",2515
"Nice printer so far - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) I purchased this printer because of the airprint feature.",2516
"I like the fact it is more like an office printer.",2517
"It holds more paper than a home printer and the ink cartridges are larger too.",2518
"One issue I am having is with the airprint feature.",2519
"I frequently have to shut the printer off and on to get it to connect.",2520
"It seems to loose connectivity when it sits idle for an extended period of time.",2521
"Since I use it at home it is not a huge hassle.",2522
"Scan interface major step backwards.",2523
"Drops wifi.",2524
"Constant whirring and spinning. - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) If you had a canon all-in-one MX printer before, you would have enjoyed using the scanning software that came with it.",2525
"The new ""software"" that came with it is slow and makes scanning much harder...",2526
"Here's what you can look forward to... -GONE ability to scan from ADF or PLATEN and accumulate pages on screen to save as single PDF.",2527
"Now you must scan each type, save it, then assemble it into a single PDF yourself. -GONE fast scanning from the ADF in most modes (it pulls paper in about 4"" then pauses for about 13 seconds before slowly finishing each page!) -GONE ability to quickly select from a single menu the source you ant to scan and then the document type (magazine, B&W document, color document, etc.). What used to take a few clicks on one menu now takes about 8 on multiple, confusing sub menus. -GONE ability to scan multiple pages then crop one or to before saving into a PDF (or printing).",2528
"THE SOFTWARE INTERFACE FOR THE SCANNER IS A CRITICAL PART OF THIS PRODUCT and I am afraid they have stopped providing the older one which was excellent and given us a crude, slow, cumbersome and almost useless downgrade of a version.",2529
"Then there is the issue of the increased spinning and whirring delays others talk about.",2530
"True.",2531
"Then there is the issue of the dropping off the wifi network randomly.",2532
"You have to power off.",2533
"Power on.",2534
"Wait 45 seconds for it to get back online and whir and click a bit before it's usable again.",2535
"True.",2536
"It does print beautifully.",2537
"It is a solidly built machine (though huge).",2538
"So if all you do is print and you don't mind waiting a long time for the whirring and spinning to stop before it finally does print, this is the model for you.",2539
"I am returning the printer and no longer recommending the Canon printers.",2540
"I used to LOVE them.",2541
"Sad.",2542
"Dead after a year & a half of light use - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) Can't complain about the set-up since my technologically challenged husband was able to do it.",2543

"Finally found out via e-mail that one did not.",2545
"We printed out some photos that were absolutely beautiful, but I have been unable to figure out how to print out 4 x 6"" photos - the most popular size!",2546
"- as there is no icon for that on the actual printer options despite showing it in every set of directions I could find on-line.",2547
"No manual came with the printer.",2548
"Tech support is available only Mon - Fri, making it very difficult for working folks to access.",2549
"On-line tutorials were completely useless & seemed to be just an endless run of commercials for the thing I already had.",2550
"After maybe a year of light use we began to have issues at times but generally got things done that we needed.",2551
"Then it stopped printing altogether.",2552
"It would make all its usual preliminary grinding & knocking sounds with the printer head whirring busily back & forth, then spit out a sheet of paper, pristine white & blank.",2553
"(All of the other reviews that say that it spends a lot of time doing this before & after a print job are spot-on.",2554
"It's very noisy & busy.",2555
"If it's truly cleaning the print head, well...read on.)",2556
"And this was right after it insisted it needed new ink.",2557
"ALL new ink.",2558
"This thing was a very thirsty beast, & replacement cartridges, though they look big, apparently contain an entire drop of ink & are expensive!",2559
"In the year & a half we used the printer I spent probably more on ink than on the printer itself.",2560
"My son, who works in IT took a look at it, spent several hours pouring over online help sites & came up with ""printer head is shot"".",2561
"So basically after a little more than a year - the last several months limping along - this noisy, thirsty beast has died.",2562
"I will never buy another Canon printer.",2563
"I would give it ""0"" stars if I could.",2564
"There is an inherent problem with on-line reviews of any piece of technology.",2565
"Most people review an item soon after purchase so you can't find a review for an item that says anything about long term problems or its longevity.",2566
"Canon can produce ""new & improved"" printers in a constant stream but you have no idea what you're actually going to get for your money.",2567
"I'm going back to HP - our last HP lasted about 5 years, ink cartridges were easy to replace & less expensive & last much longer.",2568
"It was easy to operate & produced nice prints & photos.",2569
"Fine printer - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) Yes as someone pointed out, it can be a bit noisy, but what a nice printer.",2570
"Very clear text and very nice photographs.",2571
"I have not used the fax yet so I can't comment on that feature.",2572
"Scanning documents is a breeze.",2573
"I highly recommend this printer.",2574
"My previous printer was a Epson Workforce 1100; nice printer, never failed, but this one does more and takes less space.",2575
"Printing large format with the Epson was nice but not really necessary for my day to day requirements.",2576
"Not exactly what I wanted but the best I could find - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) This item is very bulky, but it does perform a variety of operations.",2577
"I mainly wanted a high quality photo printer and chose this model because I am familiar with some older Canon photo printers that were wonderful photo printers.",2578
"Main disappointments: -could not find a printer with both card reader and USB -rather slow photo printing especially from USB -can NOT crop photo images to print as with earlier models -you must reset paper type:matte, glossy, glossy II, etc. or you are wasting both paper & ink as the quality is horrible!",2579
"Good Product - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) Most functionalities are present.",2580
"very reasonable price.",2581
"Ink consumption seems to be a little high, otherwise an excellent purchase for general home and office use.",2582
"Unable to print wirelessly (printer issue) and overly complicated menus - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) I do not recommend this printer.",2583
"It did not work well as a wireless printer with my Mac.",2584
"Canon was unable to fix the problem.",2585
"I see others online with the same issue...but no fix.",2586
"I also found the menus to be overly complicated.",2587
"First time in my life I've been totally unsatisfied with a printer...",2588
"Great Printer - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) Great printer bought it during the lighting deals could not pass it up and was definitely worth it if there any thing that could be changed would be the size its a bit bulky but nonetheless it does what it supposed to do.",2589
"print awesome the wireless capability is great easy set up by far the easiest printer set up i have ever done.",2590
"Large, Plastic, Noisy - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) This printer is awkward, slow, and noisy.",2591
"I feel very bad having such a large piece of plastic in my house, too.",2592
"I was replacing my brother mfc-4800w which was a much better smaller machine.",2593
"For some reason the wireless connection stopped working in that one, but now I might see what I can do to revive it a little harder.",2594
"I purchased this product in part because of the ADF feature.",2595
"Well, less than 24 hours out of the box and ADF jams when trying to print or scan.",2596
"Instruction manuals or lack there of are of no help to fix this.",2597
"The Canon MX922 - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) It is adequate but not nearly as user friendly as the 892.",2598
"Having to wait and then rename and save each document is time consuming and an irritation.",2599
"This a a nice, high-quality printer that produces great results.",2600
"But like other reviewers, the claim that it takes mere ""seconds"" to print is a stretch because it does take several minutes of churning and clicking to warm up before producing one single sheet.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Also, the life of the print cartridges runs pretty close to standard older printers.",2601
"However, the cost of replacing those print cartridges is cheaper than old models so I'm happy with that.",2602
"Also, I'm enjoying the ability to wirelessly print documents from my smartphones.",2603
"Definitely an improvement over older printers.",2604
"They should rename this model the Hari Kiri, because that's what it will drive you to. - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) The worse printer i've EVER owned.",2605
"I pride myself on owning my printers (HP & Canon) for many years before they finally crap out, and I'm satisfied I got my money's worth and then some.",2606
"After owning this printer for only a few months, I feel I could go work for Canon tech support, as I know how to interpret and fix every error code this printer has, and I feel like I've seen them ALL.",2607
"I could live with the noise it produces, that it's pretty big for a printer, and that's it's really slow, but this printer eats paper and ink like it's going out of style.",2608
"CONTINUOUSLY HAS PAPER JAMS.",2609
"Originally I thought it was the paper quality I was using, and switched out, that didn't help!",2610
"If ONE of the ink cartridges is dry, then it will not print anything until it's replaced, so you better have replacement cartridges on hand at all times.",2611
"Even if you're printing only a B&W, and a color cartridge is empty, it will hold you hostage for your print job until the color cartridge is replaced.",2612
"The error (support) messages it produces makes me feel like Davinci Codes' fictional hero Robert Langdon, trying to figure out what the true meaning is of that symbol (code).",2613
"GUARANTEED, that whatever you have to do will not make sense, Check out Canon printer blogs specifically for this model, and you will see scores of owners asking for help to figure out one of a multitude of codes that make this printer inoperable even if it's the simplest thing.",2614
"Don't be fooled by the glowing reviews for this model (like I was), purchasing this item is a study in frustration.",2615
"Good Printer but needs a larger - 251 Black ink Cartridge - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) Bought this Printer - works great - the only reason I wouldn't give it a 4-5 star is due to the ink usage- the 251 blk cartridge is small - I really don't print a huge amount.",2616
"of things- guess that's where they ""get-ya""!",2617
"Other than that - works great looks good - just wish Canon would make a bigger 251 Blk ink cartridge",2618
"A lot more user friendly than its predecessor - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) Much easier to use.",2619
"Only complaint, and nothing new, it goes through ink pretty quickly and, of course, the ink cartridge replacements are steep.",2620
"Acceptable print quality but fax is utterly useless - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) Perhaps what I have experienced with this machine is reflective of the vagaries associated with multi-function devices.",2621
"The print quality is acceptable if one never wishes to print images larger than 8.5 X 11.good but far from great, but that is to be expected with machines of this genre.",2622
"My complaint is with the fax function.",2623
"Yes, I have read and re-read the manual but I have never been able to send a fax despite multiple efforts.",2624
"Sadly, this one is going into the trash and I will replace it with an Epson.",2625
"Best printer we've owned - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) Auto-duplex, works with my iPad native printing feature, and, AND, the best part: It's been telling us the ink is low for at least two months, but it keeps on printing.",2626
"It says every ink tank but one is either very low or empty, but it keeps going.",2627
"We've owned printers where one color runs out and the printer says, ""Nope.",2628
"I'm done.",2629
"Fill up the cyan.""",2630
"Not this baby.",2631
"OH, and it opens the paper door automatically, so you don't have to go to some other room of the house to do it.",2632
"Outstanding printer, we're very happy with this purchase.",2633
"I returned mine. - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) * The good: separate (inexpensive) inks, duplex printing and scanning.",2634
"Basically that's why I got that printer.",2635
"* the bad: thinks and process for a long time before printing (wireless print).",2636
"Not good if you're in a rush.",2637
"Scanning at decent quality takes forever.",2638
"I tried to scan about 15 pages (2-sided) and I waited for almost 20 minutes.",2639
"I don't scan a lot so I was about to compromise but then I found out that the scans do not OCR on the fly!!",2640
"you have to do a separate process if your want your PDF's to be searchable.",2641
"Good bye.",2642
"Also, it's bulky and ugly.",2643
"The keys/buttons are impossible to keep clean, without fingerprints.",2644
"Great Printer - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) Only had this printer for a month, but it has worked great since we purchased it.",2645
"The wireless set up was very simply.",2646
"Scanning document to USB drive was very easy.",2647
"I know there are many more features that I have yet to discover.",2648
"Great product.",2649
"Canon should have made this better - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) This printer was disappointing, it is noisy and takes way to long to ramp up.",2650
"It seem to want to go through a inordinate amount of checking before its ready.",2651
"The wifi is a joke, it can't seem to make up its mind what to do.",2652
"VERY SLOW - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) Have never had a printer take so much time to ""think about"" job that has been sent to it.",2653
"Printing adequate.",2654
"Just takes way to long to complete project.",2655
"Disappointed.",2656
"used for 3 wks - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) So far so good.",2657
"It is a bit slow to get ready to print and I haven't had to replace any ink yet.",2658
"I would not hesitate to by buy it again, but you are impatient... - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) I really like this printer.",2659
"It prints all my family's daily work and homework and everything looks as expected.",2660
"The wireless connectivity has been flawless and the scanning functionality (scan to PC) actually works hassle free unlike my last HP multifunction.",2661
"Also, unlike my HP printers from the past, aftermarket ink has worked EVERY time without warning me about my horrible sin of using non-OEM ink.",2662
"The aftermarket cartridges I've used have worked flawlessly thus far (several months of heavy usage).",2663
"Just one warning/con.",2664
"If you are the impatient type who stands by the printer while it prints you may throw it out the window!",2665
"It is famous for spending what seems like minutes preparing to print.",2666
"Particularly after installing a new cartridge!",2667
"I promise you, it will occur to you that maybe it is broken as it spends minutes making all sorts of noises.",2668
"Just trust the pages will be printed.",2669
"Once the first page is out, it generally doesn't have any additional delays, but that first page can drive you to drink if you are in a hurry.",2670
"There is a part of me that is like that, but I calm myself by reminding myself that I'm not paying $100 each time I have to replace the full set of inks.",2671
"I think I can get a full set for closer to $25!",2672
"Serenity Now!",2673
"What to do without professional help - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) So far it is okay but we had to have a professional help up with the set up....still not sure about everything.",2674

"Will try to figure it out!!!!",2676
"larger then expected - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) Printer does a great job.",2677

"nice printer - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) did not get 5 stars as canon does not support my new windows phone.",2681
"otherwise good printer and much quieter than my previous kodak.",2682
"but ink here on amazon that is unbranded and save alot over canon's own",2683
"Older Seems Better -- Except for CD Printing - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) Before we write another word, please understand that we purchased this printer from a source other than Amazon.",2684
"Now for the printer itself.",2685
"We purchased it to use along side an older Canon PIXMA MX870.",2686
"When push comes to shove, the old MX870 wins for daily printing.",2687
"The biggest reason is that the older model is quieter and, overall, just as fast as the newer MX922.",2688
"The footprints are about the same.",2689
"We did a large scan job, using both the MX870 and MX992 side by side.",2690
"While the MX922 seemed to scan and print faster than the MX870, in the long run there was little or no difference.",2691
"By the time the MX922 finished with its usual clicking, clacking, pausing, and ink pump regeneration the MX870 was just as far along on the project.",2692
"Yes, the MX922 can be noisy and subject to long pauses when printing.",2693
"The old MX870 is quiet, smooth, and a steady worker compared to the MX922.",2694
"But there is a bright side!",2695
"The MX922 does a nice, quiet job printing directly to CDs.",2696
"We have printed literally hundreds of CDs on HP White Matte Ink Jet discs.",2697
"Direct printing of labels on CDs has become its major role.",2698
"Yes, it does a nice job printing on paper, too.",2699
"We have no print quality complaints.",2700
"If you don't mind a bit of clicking and clacking, go for it!",2701
"If you plan to print on CDs, buy some XL size cartridges.",2702
"Hard to understand how to use - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) I can do the basics w/ this machine but anything more needed , I cannot use.",2703
"I had a Canon before this, scanner stopped using.",2704
"Both had terrible instructions on how to detail a task.",2705

"But interrupts phone calls. - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) Performs very well with all of its functions.",2707
"Was fairly easy to set up.",2708
"But it interrupts incoming voice calls treating them as fax calls.",2709
"I prints but....... - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) I have had this printer for a few months and looked at a lot of printers before purchasing it.",2710
"The main reason I decided on this model was from a review that reported it would continue to print in black even if the color cartridges were low or empty.",2711
"I have not found this to be a true statement.",2712
"It does have a very large footprint which doesn't matter to me.",2713
"It has a quiet mode which is very quiet and it it is fairly fast.",2714
"The first few months I had it I had to keep reenterring the network information into it, however I haven't had to do that for about a month so that problem seems to be solved.",2715
"It uses a lot of ink compared to other printers that I have had even though it is set to draft mode.",2716
"When ever one of the ink cartridges runs low it starts miss aligning text even though it is set to print in grey scale only.",2717
"Clearly it uses all the ink, all the time, which is a little costly compared to the HP it replaced.",2718
"I would not buy this printer again and would probably go back to an HP.",2719
"Does a decent job - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) This printer really does a pretty good job for being such a fragile plastic machine.",2720
"Just don't get too close to the open exit door when walking by or you will snap off the extension that keeps the papers from falling to the floor.",2721
"It is the biggest ink hog of any printer that we have ever owned.",2722
"It handles network printing without a hiccup.",2723
"Even so, I doubt that we will be keeping this printer as long as we have all previous ones.",2724
"A piece of junk - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) Here is the problem!",2725
"Looked nice sounded nice BUT the first one I got didn't work, got a code 6000 paper jam code, before I could get to putting in the cartridges, called Canon they couldn't help me all they wanted to do was send me a reconditioned printer!",2726
"They were NO help to me at all I am not happy with Canon at all!!.",2727
"However Amazon was great, I called them and they sent me a second printer, over night with a printable form via email to return the one that didn't work, what a great company!!",2728
"Well now about the second printer!",2729
"followed direction like I did on the first one only more carefully, I got to the same point and it gave a code 5101 a piece of packing tape not removed code well all the tape was removed but the code would not go away!",2730
"same thing called Canon they couldn't and didn't help me and again wanted to send me a reconditioned printer What a messed up company!!!",2731
"So I called Amazon they came through for me again told me to send everything back for a full credit and gave me the credit before they got the printers back man I love that Amazon they are the best!!!",2732
"Canon sucks BIG time!!",2733
"Bought at a great price. - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) I have not owned the printer too long as of yet and this a replacement for a 892.",2734
"Feels bulkier but better built.",2735
"It is missing the direct ports for the SD cards like the 892.",2736
"I like the fact it holds more paper, prints better (although slower) Also scans very slow compared to the 892.",2737
"The scanner stops during every page and resumes slowly.",2738
"What would take a few seconds with the previous takes close to a minute for just 4 pages.",2739
"I took the 2 year (1 year extended) warranty from Square Trade with it because I had a 310 and a 892 that broke down after 1.5 years of use and were unrepairable or not cost effective to fix.",2740
"I hope this one last longer.",2741
"Setup took longer and there are still some settings that I have to adjust.",2742
"With my previous printers my scanned documents would go to a Canon folder.",2743
"These went into the general My Document folder and were a bit more difficult to find.",2744
"The menu is a bit more complex and is going to take some getting used too.",2745
"Overall I do like Canon printers for their printing but if I could have found another printer with the features I needed at the same price and in the top ten of CR, I would have tried a different brand.",2746
"terrible printer!",2747
"- Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) Boy, do I ever wish I had not bought this awful printer.",2748

"Even when it does work it is unbelievably slow and noisy.",2750
"I bought it because it was so highly rated by PC Magazine.",2751
"They must be getting kickbacks from Canon because this is a total dud of a printer.",2752
"uses a lot of ink - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) Nice pictures, but uses a lot of ink and very expensive.",2753
"I would look a little harder before I bought another one.",2754
"not bad printer!",2755
"Very Useful - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) I use this as my home office printer, and so far it has worked great.",2756
"I don't think I'll ever use it for all that it is capable of, but the wireless printing is a great feature.",2757
"I've tested some high quality photo prints on regular paper and I am only somewhat impressed.",2758
"Perhaps the glossy paper will bring out the better detail.",2759
"The paper tray is a little tricky underneath the printer and there isn't enough room for my fingers to slide the tray back in after refilling it.",2760
"But overall I am very satisfied and highly recommend this printer.",2761
"print quality is nice, but it is unbelievably slow - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) too slow to actually use in most cases.",2762
"makes me wonder if there's a problem with it, but who has the time to return stuff anymore?",2763
"Excellent price - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) The price that I paid for this device is, indeed, very good because it has a lot of features: it has a wireless module, it can print pictures at a good quality and it also features a scanner and a copier.",2764
"But, there are a couple of drawbacks.",2765
"It's a bit noisy, it vibrates while working and it also jams the photo paper from time to time.",2766
"Still, this was a good deal.",2767
"Very pleased, good shipping as well - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) Printing is great, has just about everything needed in small office printing environment.",2768

"Install was fairly easy.",2771
"Have multiple computers and wasn't too clear on how to install just the print drivers on each computer.",2772
"Played with the software and got it installed on all of them though.",2773
"Would buy another.",2774

"The price and features of this printer were very attractive, so I purchased one.",2811
"My initial impressions are: Print quality is good, but you probably need to put the setting on High Quality, the scanner works fine if you want to scan to a printer, but I cannot seem to get it to scan to a USB drive (it keeps complaining that a drive is not inserted), and my biggest disappointment is the speed.",2812
"It takes a very long time to get warmed up when you first turn it on, and then when it begins to print, the pages come out much slower than I had expected.",2813
"But, for the price, I suppose one cannot expect much more.",2814

"There are two cassettes -- one for letter sized paper and envelopes, and a 2nd tray for small pieces of paper (pretty useless for me.)",2864
"That's right -- the letter sized paper and the envelopes share the same tray, but not simultaneously.",2865
"I'm using this for business.",2866

"Print, copy, scan functions seem quite good.",2882
"Haven't had a chance to use the fax yet.",2883
"Amazon price definitely is good.",2884
"I gave this device a four star (instead of five) rating because (as other reviewers have noted) sometimes the device decides to perform a head-cleaning or a self-diagnostic right before or in the middle of printing something, and this can take quite a bit of time (very inconvenient, especially if you're trying to print something out just before dashing out the door).",2885
"Seems to me the printer could be programmed to do its house-keeping when it's idle rather than just when it is asked to perform a function.",2886
"Also, be aware that the paper tray is automated and will pop open when you print.",2887
"So if you tend to park things in front of the tray door (like me) you may have a problem (for instance, generate a paper jam).",2888

"This printer is so darn slow!",2911
"The start up process itself takes 3 minutes or more.",2912
"So if you want to print a single page quickly and your printer is off, you should wait about 5 minute to get the printed paper.",2913
"I also had to replace the ink tank since it finished kind of quickly and the print quality of the new ink tank is just horrible (although it is the original canon ink).",2914
"The print quality after ink replacement has a low resolution and it is not as sharp as it used to be.",2915
"Drinks INK like it is going out of style - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) I recently bought this printer and have found that after printing 30 black and white documents, all of the ink cartridges need to be replaced.",2916
"Machine must be defective or something.",2917
"Good printer at a fair value - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) A really good MFP for the price.",2918

"Although I'm worried that the ink would run out soon (already?!) PROS: good scanning - can also be double-sided, speed is OK software that came with is has a lot of functionality supports OCR two trays - for photo paper and normal letter sized paper CONS: as with almost all printers, the device itself may be cheap but the cartridge is expensive bulky - but for what it offers, what do you expect?",2920

"Times have changed.",2922
"Now it's got bigger and makes more noise, taking more time to set it up.",2923

"On a side note, I see a higher number of flies in my house since I provisioned this printer.",2925
"I hope something didn't die in it.",2926
"I'll take a good look inside.",2927
"These days as all of our electronic devices seem to be getting smaller, this combo printer/copier/scanner/fax machine is the largest that I've seen in years!",2928
"It just barely fits into the space I've designated for it.",2929
"That said, it seems as solid as any printer I've owned.",2930
"(And it should, given the size!) Set-up was easy and since it works wirelessly as well as with a USB connection, there wasn't much to be connected.",2931
"Since it has WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup) if you have a router with the same, you can connect your wireless devices by simply pressing and holding down the button on the router while pressing the OK button in the printer setup screen.",2932
"The rest of the setup goes pretty quickly.",2933
"The print quality is very good.",2934
"I haven't done a lot of photos so far but what I have done turned out very well.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The printer has lots of nice features like printing on both sides of the paper automatically without having to manually turn the paper over.",2935
"It has high resolution and can print borderless photos.",2936
"There are four ink cartridges but when one color runs out it can be changed singly without having to change them all at once.",2937
"If you have an Air Print compatible iPhone or iPad you can print wirelessly from your device with this printer.",2938
"You can scan printer copy up to 35 pages at a time in the feeder without having to stand there and feed them one at a time.",2939
"I use this printer often to scan and save documents from my computer and it's very simple to use and you can save documents in the PDF format.",2940
"For example, I will scan receipts for my expense account, save them as a .pdf and then attach the .pdf to an email to send off to my company.",2941
"It's simple to do and saves me a lot of time.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The only drawbacks that I have seen with this printer is that it often goes through what sounds like some sort of set up with gears turning in papers shifting before it prints the document.",2942
"This seems to happen when I haven't used it for a day or two.",2943
"It can take a couple minutes before it actually gets around to printing.",2944
"The other complaint is that it frequently loses its Wi-Fi connection.",2945
"I'm not sure why this happens.",2946
"It's easy enough to reconnect with the WPS, but can be a little annoying when I go to print something and find out that it's not connected.&#13;&#10;",2947
"What a POS - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) Not only does this thing make racket for 10 minutes after it prints a page, and yes the eco silent mode is on, but it never stays connected to the wireless network nor can you ever make it stop printing double sided.",2948
"The print options are always set to one side printing and the WiFi indication always indicates it's connected.",2949
"Go figure.",2950
"It worked great the first couple of weeks.",2951
"But like everything else, it's 7 days past the time I can return it and it craps out!",2952
"A noisy, error prone printer with expensive ink....",2953

"Performs well - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) Extremely pleased with the AirPrint capability and the rest of the wireless functions.",2966

"The print quality is good.",2971
"I need to try more photos for a better judgement there.",2972
"Great printer!",2973
"- Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) This is a great home printer/scanner/copier (I haven't used the fax element so I can't speak to that.)",2974
"Paper and replacement ink are easy to load.",2975
"I like the wireless capability.",2976
"Makes good copies for my use here at home.",2977

"Great product for the price. - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) This is a great printer for occasional home use.",2980
"I had to call support to get the scanner set up, but other than that it has been very easy to use.",2981
"SOUNDED LIKE IT WAS DYING THEN IT DIED - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) From the moment I turned it on, it sounded like it was dying, then it pretty much died.",2982
"Didn't do much printing at all, but of course the larger of the 2 black cartridges showed EMPTY, then it stopped entirely.",2983
"The other black cartridge was full.",2984
"What is it for?",2985
"Extremely heavy.",2986
"I nearly broke my back lifting it.",2987

"The wireless not too great, I read that going in, networking cable or usb no problems.",2993
"Have not tried scanner but am confident its ok.",2994
"Dont need fax.",2995
"After reading reviews for a week came to this as least expensive best option, very happy so far.",2996
"It's excellent fo the price but has it's flaws - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) This printer has it's pros and cons.",2997
"It can do most anything you want, it looks beautiful and the quality of the scanner and printer are great.",2998
"Also it wasn't too hard to set up or link with other computers in the house.",2999
"However, it is slow to warm up, slow between printing document and sends error messages constantly about low toner when there is plenty (just under half full).",3000
"The quality of the machine is kind of flimsy, the bottom paper tray is not easy to grasp and paper will not feed if the printer has any pressure on the bottom of the drawer as it is the bottom of the actual printer.",3001
"Also the paper output tray is so fragile I am afraid if I forget to close it after I use, it would only take one small incident to snap it off.",3002
"It is worth the money though.",3003
"great printer, fast delivery - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) This printer was delivered 3 days after it was ordered.",3004
"I was so surprised.",3005

"There is one small annoyance.",3010
"The printer powers off automatically and must be turned on before printing.",3011
"kludgy - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) This all-in-one more or less does what Canon claims, but it just feels like a really kludgy product, especially considering how old this model line is.",3012
"You would think that they'd improve and streamline the product but this one seems worse than the MX860 that I used for two years before it bricked out.",3013
"Whenever I need to scan something, the printer runs through it's suite of exercises before it actually scans.",3014
"The printer head seems to move back and forth, along with all sorts of other moving internal parts.",3015
"I'm not printing though so why can't it just scan without doing the whole warm up routine?",3016
"This delay is much longer and much noisier than it was with the MX860.",3017
"Also, sometimes when I need to scan something, the printer can't find my computer on the wireless network, so I have to go through the scan software on the computer to tell the printer to do the scan.",3018
"It's a minor thing, but it's a pain in the neck.",3019
"The old model used to scan just fine and send the files to my computer.",3020
"The menu navigation is also clumsy.",3021
"I bought this printer because I had a bunch of toner cartridges from the old printer and thought I would be able to reuse them on this model, but I didn't look closely enough to realize that the toner model numbers have changed slightly so they don't actually fit.",3022
"I really regret it.",3023
"I won't be coming back for another Canon printer in a year when this one breaks.",3024
"Too slow.",3025
"Every time I start printing it takes 20-30 seconds to warm up and start.",3026
"The double sided sheet feeder is a nice option.",3027
"Defaults to wrong tray - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) I find that this printer defaults to the top tray which does not fit 8.5 x 11 paper.",3028
"It tries to take paper from that tray first then goes to the bottom tray and takes forever to print.",3029
"I cannot figure out how to make it default to the bottom tray even when I create a default setting picking the bottom tray.",3030
"I print somethings that go directly to the printer and they will not print because it chose the top tray then I cannot again because I'm only aloud to print it once.",3031
"I've had many Canon printers before and loved them - that's why I bought another.",3032
"This is the worst printer I've ever owned!",3033
"Wish I hadn't thrown out the box or it would have been sent back long ago.",3034
"piece of cr*^&p - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) I have owned several Canon AIO and never had a problem with any of them, after 1 ½ months this one is broke.",3035
"I awoke in the middle of the night to it constantly rebooting it self, adding insult to injury the display window says "" power was not turned off correctly the last time .""",3036

"Works like a charm - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) I read the reviews before purchasing and was a little skeptical but ordered anyway.",3047
"I've now set up and used the machine for several weeks and I love it.",3048
"The setup for wireless was a little difficult to understand at first.",3049
"But it comes with a CD that operates the printer to guide you while you are setting it up.",3050
"That is by far better then the written startup guide that comes with the machine.",3051
"I set up and registered ""Google Print"" on the machine so I can send documents to print and give my family access as well.",3052
"That works like a charm.",3053
"So far its a workhorse that's doing well.",3054
"Great Printer - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) Love this printer because it prints duplex, which will save in the long run when printing so many papers, and doing income taxes, it so needed.",3055

"But for what i need it for its ideal!",3059
"Dead after purchasing Funerary 19, 2014 - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) Yes the printer displayed the dreaded ""6000"" error code after purchasing the printer to replace another Canon Printer MX870 that lasted about seven years and this one only lasted from February 19, 2014 to April 19, 2014 wow.",3060
"I also see that others printer only lasted about the same time four months and broke for some strange reason.",3061
"I contacted Canon and got ""iYogi?s support services"" and after installing software on my pc to allow the support person access to my pc to diagnose the printer error 6000 code, he was unable to repair or give any reason for the error and asked if I had purchased the Amazon service warranty and after checking my order from Amazon I did not.",3062
"So now do I purchase another Canon or HP like the support person suggested and after reviewing the HP6600 here at Amazon it appears to be more problematic than the Canon.",3063

"Prints well--if you can ever get it working - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) I am disgusted with this printer.",3067
"It looks good and prints well (once you can actually get it connected and working).",3068
"So far we have spent an hour on the phone with Canon trying to get it connected.",3069
"Canon support was not able to tell us why it will not register as a wireless printer.",3070
"Then we started the arduous process of getting the print by e-mail function to work, which is the whole reason I got this printer.",3071
"There is a complicated process by which you have to print out a page that gives you a URL and password to register the printer for print by e-mail.",3072
"We got the page with the URL and password to print out, and it says that the URL expires in 25 minutes.",3073
"We entered the URL and password right away and it said it had expired.",3074
"We repeated the process and it once again said it had expired less than 3 minutes after the URL was given.",3075
"I even tried it on two different computers.",3076
"Now Amazon says I can't return it.",3077
"Save your money--this thing does not work!!",3078

"But, when it decides that it has better things to do than my printing task, it will go off into a mode making internal noises and the screen will say ""Please wait momentarily"".",3080
"This can take quite a few ""moments"".",3081
"What is with that?",3082
"Great machine at an excellent price - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) I bought this when my HP printer died just as I was printing our Christmas letter.",3083
"I needed a printer quickly, so I didn't do as much research as I would normally do for a purchase like this - basically I checked out Amazon's top sellers, then read the reviews.",3084
"This one seemed to have everything I needed and the price was right.",3085
"Because of the low price, I was actually very surprised at the quality of this printer.",3086
"The only thing that feels a bit flimsy is the main paper cassette, everything else feels like a well-built and expensive machine.",3087
"Print quality is very good.",3088
"Photos are true to color and very crisp, and I love its ability to print right to the edge of the paper.",3089

"I have not set up the fax for the printer, but scanning and printing work fine.",3097
"I called Canon support to help me set up the printer initially, and was especially impressed with the help I received.",3098
"The representative walked me through all the steps in 20 minutes.",3099
"It would have taken me all day on my own.",3100
"That in itself is worth buying a canon product.",3101

"After some problems - continued paper jams- decided to try a Canon.",3103

"So far no problems.",3105
"Running with a mix of Apple and Windows machines.",3106

"Copier and other feature also great.",3113
"The demo ink is so little, so print less or you have to buy a refill kit",3114
"great printer, fast delivery - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) This printer was delivered 3 days after it was ordered.",3115

"The fax capability is easy to understand and use.",3120
"There is one small annoyance.",3121
"The printer powers off automatically and must be turned on before printing.",3122
"With Canon's reliability, I am looking forward to many years of good printing.",3123
"The unit I received from the Amazon seller was easy to set up and printed as promised, but none of the lights on the keypad lit up (can't use commands as they are invisible), nor did the blue light that signifies a wifi connection.",3124
"I had to order a replacement from Canon, and the replacement seems to do everything more slowly than the first.",3125
"It takes a while to warm up to print, but the print quality is good, and I can print from quite a distance away.",3126
"I LOVE being able to print from my iPad and iPhone.",3127
"Copying is also laboriously slow, but it's for home use so I am ok with that.",3128
"I don't have a hard line phone connection so can't use the fax function, and I haven't tried the scanner yet.",3129

"I seldom write reviews, but don't bother with this printer... - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) 'Had a great all in one Dell printer...always printed perfectly (photos, etc.). I decided it was time to get a new one and did a lot of research.",3131
"Everything said buy this printer.",3132

"I wouldn't recommend buying this.",3135
"Printing envelopes - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) Wish I had been warned that the MX922 will not print envelopes unless you remove all the paper in the lower tray.",3136
"The top tray is only good for pictures.",3137
"My assumption that in order to cut costs, they eliminated the ease of printing #10 envelopes.",3138
"My previous MX870 had rear paper feed that the paper could easily be removed & envelopes added.",3139
"Not the MX922.",3140
"You have to remove all the paper & move the guides (not an easy task) to fit a #10 envelope, print the envelope, move the guide [again not an easy task] back for the 8 1/2 x 11 paper, then reinsert the paper.",3141
"If you want a printer that prints envelopes, don't get this one.",3142
"Great Printer....When It Will Connect With The Router - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) Bought this printer several months ago and was impressed with its performance for about 3 weeks.",3143
"Then unexpectedly, the wireless connection was terminated.",3144
"I followed the manual instructions for reconnection and it worked just fine again...until the printer went to sleep and once again the wireless connection was terminated and would not reconnect.",3145
"This same scenario has now been going on for almost 6 weeks with the printer working long enough to print a few documents and then not able to connect or even recognize my router.",3146
"I tried quite a few things over and over including manually entering the routers password, cold booting the computer, modem, router and printer.",3147
"Resetting the printer's settings back to default and uninstalling and reinstalling the printer's drivers and software to no avail.",3148
"I spent countless hours researching every article and every forum discussion I could find on the topic and discovered that others experienced the same problem, but had found no solution.",3149
"One person said they had called the router's tech support and was told it was a problem with the Canon MX922 configuration and then called the printer's tech support and was told it was the router's configuration.",3150
"So guess who got caught in the middle with a printer that won't print wirelessly (this printer has worked fine with a wired connection)?",3151
"The next thing I did was to admit defeat, so I too broke down and called the router's tech support.",3152
"They asked me if I had other wireless devices such as phones and a computer that was connected to the router, which I do have and they work just fine.",3153
"They informed me that it was a problem on the printer's side...not the router because the router obviously works for those other devices.",3154
"My response was to ask the question, ""Is it possible that the router is not configured correctly for the printer?""",3155
"But that question basically fell on deaf ears.",3156
"They did say they could connect me with a pay service with no guarantee that a solution would be found.",3157
"But pay for service on a device under $100 just doesn't make a lot of sense since I can now buy one for around $50.",3158
"On to the next possibility.",3159
"I called Canon for their assistance.",3160
"I will say that the young lady I talked with was extremely courteous and quite knowledgeable.",3161
"Much more so than the routers tech support which seem scripted and delivered by someone with a very low voice and with an accent that I had a hard time understanding.",3162
"But again, all of the hoops the Canon tech had me jump through didn't get me any closer to solving the problem.",3163
"She did, however, say one thing that gave me hope.",3164
"She said that the printer is designed to run on a router with 2.4 GHz single band.",3165
"I have a dual band 2.4 GHz/5 GHz router.",3166
"So today I have gone back into the router's settings and disabled the 5 GHz frequency settings.",3167
"The Canon tech said that the printer may have connected and worked while it was in the 2.4 GHz mode, but many comments I have read say that the router will often times choose to connect at the higher 5 GHz setting even if the lower 2.4 GHz setting is stronger.",3168
"That might explain why I am sometimes able to connect for a little while and then not able to connect a little later.",3169
"I say all of this so if you have a dual band router, you may want to consider another printer, or realize you may have to get a different router if you expect this Canon MX922 to work properly.",3170
"The problem may very well be specific to my particular brand and model router, I really don't know.",3171
"If the changes I have made to my router's setting disabling the 5 GHz settings work for the next couple of weeks, I will post a follow up to these comments.",3172
"I hope that others with dual band routers that are using this printer successfully will comment to the affirmative.",3173
"It is not my intent to shoot down or bad mouth a product because I am not tech savvy enough to solve the problem myself.",3174
"When this printer is working, it does a very good job with good print quality and it is fast enough for most peoples needs.",3175
"But in this day and age, when a new piece of equipment is not designed to intuitively connect as it is supposed to, it is hard to give a more favorable recommendation.",3176
"Quality is good.",3177
"You will GO BROKE buying ink. - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) This unit sucks ink like a banshee.",3178
"Either that or free market capitalism has gone to their head and Canon is in the ink business, not the printer business.",3179
"TERRIBLE rate of consumption of ink.",3180
"You can NOT afford this printer.",3181
"We've had ours about four months and have spent twice the price of the printer in ink.",3182
"And NO, we are not print-happy.",3183
"Worst ink-to-cost ratio printer we've ever owned.",3184
"Run for your life.",3185
"Save your wallet.",3186
"Nice printer, hopeless software bundle - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) Let me say first of all the the printing quality seems to be excellent.",3187
"I've used Epsons for several years because of the waterproof pigment ink, but I need to be able to do direct printing on CDs & DVDs and nobody seems to do that with pigment inks.",3188
"I do have an Epson at work that I use for DVDs and CDs and wanted the same capability at home - labels are problematic at best. .",3189
"We found the Canon on sale on Cyber Monday at half the price of the comparable Epson and it became my Christmas present.",3190
"Anyway, photo printing on this printer seems better than my old Epson C88, with better color, and that extends to scanning and copying as well.",3191
"2-side scanning, printing, and copying so far have worked flawlessly!",3192
"Setup on my WiFi was a breeze and I'm very pleased with the hardware.",3193
"However, I continue to wonder WHY companies persist in spending tons of money to saddle users with elaborate software that is just AWFUL!!!",3194
"F-ING AWFUL in fact.",3195
"""Image garden"" which gives you lots of crappy templates but makes it nearly impossible to print what you really want on your disc (there are ways if you search the web, but you'll want to print the directions out and keep them with the printer).",3196
"And if you use another app to make a nice round disc label you'll never get it to line up with the actual disc unless you fuzz it into the Canon Image Garden software.",3197
"SO - if you want to print directly on discs, an Epson is probably a better choice because they have a very straightforward utility that lets you set up the parameters of your disc (including printable area etc.), and then place and warp text and add any graphics you want.",3198
"If you've ever used PowerPoint you'll be comfortable with the Epson software in about 10 minutes.",3199
"As far as the Canon software, I think I'm going to have to spend $40-50 on 3rd party software -- which pretty much undoes the cost difference with the Epson!",3200
"GET A CLUE, CANON!",3201
"So...",3202
"hardware, five stars.",3203
"Bundled software, ridiculous.",3204
"Great Quality - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) I really love this printer.",3205
"I will warn you it is a bit noisy when it finishes printing.",3206
"It acts like it is printing 3 more pages and then shuts down.",3207
"Very cool how you can scan to what ever PC you want from the printer itself.",3208
"AirPrint works every time!",3209
"It will swap paper feeds based on what paper you select from your computer/device.",3210
"great printer at an affordable price - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) it's a great printer, and does everything it says in the product details.",3211
"The packaging is very user-friendly, the bag holding the printer has handles, so I easily lifted out of the box.",3212
"But the user manual is just way too simple, not everyone is computer or printer savvy, they need to be more specific and give better instructions on certain things.",3213
"For example, i had to google what it means to "" hold down the WPS button"" and press on ok on the printer.",3214
"Just write in the instruction menu that "" the WPS button is not on the printer, it's on the router,"" that would have made things much easier for me.",3215
"also?",3216
"they should include a USB cable in the package, those things are like 2 bucks for sale on Amazon.",3217
"Pros and Cons - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) My first experience with this printer was not so great.",3218
"It was dead on arrival (faulty print head, and only blank pages would print), so after lots of time with Canon customer service, they determined we needed a new one.",3219
"But Canon's policy is to send a refurbished printer as a replacement for a brand new printer.",3220
"Lame.",3221
"So be sure to let them know that you'll be making the exchange through Amazon.",3222
"(Canon didn't listen and sent me a refurbished one anyway, which meant I had two printers to return-one to Canon and one to Amazon.",3223
"In Canon's defense, however, they did send me some free ink cartridges as compensation for my trouble.)",3224
"The new printer that Amazon sent arrived before the old one was returned.",3225
"So 5 stars for Amazon customer service!",3226
"And this one worked perfectly right out of the box.",3227
"I am a freelance graphic designer who never sends faxes, and is this is my home office printer, so I can't speak to its uses in an office environment.",3228
"But here's what I like and don't like so far: Cons first: · Ink is expensive, so the cost per page is pretty high and will probably end up costing us more in the long run than a more expensive printer with cheaper ink.",3229
"· Getting the printer running takes foooorehhhhhverrrr.",3230
"I've had Canon printers before, but I've never had one that needed this much time just to get *ready* to print.",3231
"(Once it's ready though, the rest of the pages come through fairly fast.)",3232
"So if you don't mind pushing ""print"" and then going to grab a cup of coffee while the machine warms up, then this won't bother you.",3233
"If you're in a hurry to meet a deadline, however, it will make you tear your hair out.",3234
"· No USB or Ethernet cord included for scanning.",3235
"And abysmally bad information for setting up the scanner-as in, it doesn't exist.",3236
"Nowhere in any of the guides does it say that a cord is required for scans from this ""wireless"" printer, and they don't include one in the box to give you the hint.",3237
"So it took me an hour to dig through old boxes before I found an old ethernet cord that would connect to my computer and allow me to scan.",3238
"And then I had to go to Canon's website to download the TWAIN driver to use the scanner from Photoshop.",3239
"Apparently they don't think people really need this feature.",3240
"But I do.",3241
"Often.",3242
"Now that the scanner is communicating with my computer, it works great.",3243
"The setup was just a big fat pain.",3244
"· It's a big machine and needs a lot of real estate on your desk.",3245
"Pros: · Automatic duplex printing.",3246
"Boom.",3247
"· Truly remarkable image quality.",3248
"I've printed a range of photos from landscapes to portraits, and the color is just spectacular.",3249
"Truly.",3250
"The color accuracy is unlike any I've never achieved from any of my previous printers, without my having to adjust any color settings.",3251
"This makes me very, very (yes VERY) happy.",3252
"Seriously.",3253
"For a printer that uses only 4 ink colors (plus pigment black), I don't think you could find better results.",3254
"· The scanner and copier quality are terrific.",3255
"Color stays accurate, and fine lines come out crisper and more satisfying than potato chips.",3256
"· Wireless printing is a cinch, even from iPad and iPhone.",3257
"Setting it up took just a minute, and I can now print from anywhere in the house with ease.",3258
"Bottom line: In spite of my initial frustrations and the high cost of ink, I'm really happy with this printer so far, and I look forward to using it for printing everything from Word documents to frame-worthy photos.",3259
"Amazing Printer!",3260
"- Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) Amazing Printer!",3261
"I never thought that I would love a printer until I bought the Canon MX922.",3262
"It has has a ton of features, the price is reasonable and the majority of reviews were favorable.",3263
"I've put it through it's paces over the past month and here are my thoughts on it: PROs: -Individual Ink Cartridges: You only need to replace the color(s) that you use vice an all-in-one color ink cartridge that HP and other manufacturers use.",3264
"This saves money in the long run, regardless of your printing habits. -Internal Paper Tray: I love this.",3265
"No more paper sticking out the end of the printer when you're not using it.",3266
"There's an internal tray, just like a commercial laser printer, that stores the paper.",3267
"I don't recall the exact number, but it hold approximately 200 pages in the tray. -Scanner Feed Tray and Double-Sided Scanning: The top tray holds 35 pages.",3268
"Have some financial statements that you need to scan?",3269
"No problem.",3270
"Load everything up and it will scan or copy double sided. -Duplex Printing: You can print double sided.",3271
"You'd think that this would be standard on all modern printers, but it's difficult to find.",3272
"This saves on paper big time. -Wireless Ease of Use: I've printed wirelessly from both my MacBook and iPhone.",3273
"No issues at all and a big upgrade from the cumbersome systems used in early wireless printers.",3274
"You can even print from outside the house, as long as the printer is on and connected to the internet.",3275
"I haven't had a reason to do this, but it's nice to know that it's available. -Built in Templates: Hit the menu button on the printer and it's loaded with paper templates, to include: staff paper for music, notebook paper for school (college or wide ruled), graph paper, to do list, etc.",3276
"While it's not cost effective to use this as the source for all of your formatted paper needs, it works well if you only need a few sheets or if you're in a pinch. -Setup: Easy.",3277
"For some reason the printer had a hard time auto-detecting my network.",3278
"I tried a couple times and then switched to manual mode.",3279
"The printer was connected and working in less than five minutes. -Buttons: A lot of the printers that I looked at had touch screens..",3280
"1-2 inches in size.",3281
"This seemed more like a gimmick than anything useful.",3282
"I like touch screens when they're needed, but a printer works fine with old fashioned buttons.",3283
"This one is easy to use and the backlit buttons change functions based on what options your using.",3284
"CONs: -Size: This printer is HUGE!",3285
"I don't mind, given the breadth of features, but you should know that this beast is 2-3 times bigger than the average home printer.",3286
"Overall: I can easily give this thing 4 stars.",3287
"It's a versatile product that has performed well.",3288
"For home use (finances, school, etc) it does the job perfectly.",3289
"I actually enjoy printing and this does everything that I've ever wanted in a printer.",3290
"I highly recommend purchasing this.",3291
"you won't be disappointed.",3292
"*Note: I have not tested the photo printing or fax functions.",3293
"I'm sure they work well, but I don't have a need to use them.",3294
"Also, the body of the printer has a very tasteful color transition from red to black.",3295
"It's much more subtle than depicted on this Amazon picture.",3296
"Did not work out of box and 9 days later no replacement - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) Canon responded quickly and sent replacement.",3297
"Must have sent by bus.",3298
"Two day Prime doesn't mean much with this kind of support.",3299
"Still waiting.",3300
"Love the wireless printing - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) I spent a lot of time researching wireless printers, and, as someone who doesn't know a lot about technology, I found myself frustrated quite quickly.",3301
"There is such a disparity among ratings across all brands, so it is hard to predict satisfaction.",3302
"I knew I didn't want the HP wireless printer my parents have - apparently, you can only print wireless by ""emailing"" the printer - how does that work when you are trying to print a webpage from your iphone?",3303
"After hours spent, I broke down and bought the Canon based largely on a fantastic and competitive price.",3304
"Let me first say...",3305
"it is LARGE.",3306
"I am not quite sure yet where I will put it (it currently sits on the carpeted floor of my office, where it has been for a month).",3307
"I set it up very quickly and without issue.",3308
"The best part?",3309
"It is in my upstairs office, and, yet, I spent 99% of my time printing from the comfort of my living room chair.",3310
"It works without issue with my iphone, which is how I do most of my printing.",3311
"However, I also have it set up to my laptop, and it prints well from there too.",3312
"Yes, the paper tray feels a little flimsy, but I keep it open and it seems fine (even on a carpet that does not allow it to glide as well as a solid surface).",3313
"Cannot say anything yet about the printer ink, but it does concern me that there are so many cartridges, and they can be quite expensive.",3314
"I do not print daily (print mostly for leisure - recipes, coupons, etc), so I hope they last me a while.",3315
"Some features work as expected and some don't!!!",3316
"- Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) Before I get started just understand my critique on the aforementioned product is based on the feature I need the most, and that feature is the Automatic Document Feeder (ADF).",3317
"Of course, it goes without saying that quality of print, as well as, print options comes is also a top priority but with the this printer I did not find any fault in the quality of print.",3318
"Due to the nature of the business that this printer was being utilized for I have a need to scan 30 to 35 documents at a time.",3319
"My initial use of the ADF feature mangled the upper left hand corner of each page slightly (this never corrected itself) and with that I became a little unhinged and after about 3 successfully scanned sheets the very next one was jammed in the roller.",3320
"It takes a moment for the feeder to recognize the document is jammed and upon identifying that there is a jam systematically it then informs you via the display console that the printer is jammed.",3321
"You then select okay and it then begins to roll in reverse to clear the jam.",3322
"One, it doesn't do a great job of rectifying this issue, because for every 3 to 5 pages I fed through the ADF a jam occurred and I found myself slowly tugging ever so delicately upward on that jammed piece of paper in order to resolve the situation myself and save the now chewed pieces of paper.",3323
"Secondly, the scanning does not resume from the point of the jam.",3324
"So basically, I had to scan several pages at a time and after each jam I had a separate file I needed to store.",3325
"So for the first set of documents I fed into the ADF I had 6 split files all from that single feed.",3326
"If the ADF feature isn't a big deal the printer isn't the worst.",3327
"It can be a little slow when it comes down to printing but the reduced prices says you get what you pay for.",3328
"Yes, it really does deserve these bad reviews - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) I wanted this to work.",3329
"I love my seven-year old Pixma printer, but thought it was time to upgrade to a wireless version.",3330
"Unfortunately, I never got this to work properly.",3331
"It just wouldn't sync with the internet.",3332
"I thought I actually had it synced a couple times, then reality set in.",3333
"Why two stars rather than one?",3334
"When I connected my computer via cord to the printer, the printouts looked very nice, although the printing did seem slow.",3335
"Also, I am a big fan of one color per cartridge.",3336
"I have saved money in the long run by doing this.",3337
"Also, I use more black & there is the option to use black ink in a cartridge that is twice the size of the other ink cartridges.",3338
"I have no idea if the problem is the printer or the software.",3339
"Regardless, if you are able to get this to work, you are a very fortunate person.",3340
"Easy to set up - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) Easy to set up, works well with my Mac, better interface than an HP printer I tried.",3341

"It prints very fast and the print quality is very good.",3345
"I love the CD printing, which is very easy too.",3346
"On that note, I could not find the software for CD printing but I went to Canon's website and they had the software I needed!",3347
"I do find the construction of the unit to be a little flimsy, that's why it's 4/5 stars.",3348
"No Envelope Feeder ...",3349
"And It's Slow and Loud - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) I purchased this Canon MX922 printer to replace a Canon MX870 that I loved.",3350
"I was surprised and disappointed to find that the MX922 does not have a separate envelope feeder.",3351
"To print an envelope you have to remove the main paper cassette, remove the paper from it, adjust the guides, insert envelope(s), and replace the cassette ...",3352
"then go through the entire procedure in reverse to print plain paper.",3353
"Not only is this inconvenient, but the construction of the cassette is so fragile that I can't see it holding up to this repeated handling.",3354
"Other less important negatives: When you print something after the printer is idle for more than an hour or so, it goes through a several minute ""getting ready to print"" sequence before spitting out the first page.",3355
"And it's loud.",3356
"The Canon engineers failed on this one.",3357
"Printer is Noisy but does job. - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) It was easy to set up and it does the job, but it is slower and much noisier than my last Pixma MX850 (which I loved, but it broke after 13 months).",3358
"Also, the software for photos and scanning is more confusing than with previous Pixmas.",3359
"The ink cost is outrageous - even at Costco!",3360
"It arrived poorly packaged in a box that way entirely too large - so the printer moved around.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;As to the printer itself, it was horrible trying to set up to be a wireless printer.",3361

"Had trouble to connecting to things etc. I would say spend your money elsewhere.",3364
"Delivers as promised. - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) Great as a printer, but it tries to be a fax answering machine sporadically when I receive a call.",3365
"I just have not figured out how to cancel the fax ""service"" when I don't want it.",3366
"Nothing in the set up told me which box to check to avoid this.",3367

"All written instructions have been followed -- all to no avail.",3375
"Good printer for the money - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) I purchased this printer because I had a previous Canon all in one that lasted 7 years.",3376
"Right out of the box this printer did not work.",3377
"Stating it had a paper jam, but there was never a piece of paper in the machine.",3378
"I contacted Canon and they were willing to replace it with a REFURBISHED model - and I had to pay for shipping.",3379

"Like all of the other high performing inkjet printers that cost twice to three times as much, the Canon MX922 can print and fax from, as well as scan to, a PC; it can work as a standalone copier and fax machine; and it can both scan to and print from a USB key, with the ability to preview images on its three-inch color LCD.",4472

"A competent all-in-one with a small footprint - What's great about it: Price; text quality (see review); feature set . What's not so great: Software set-up could be better; slow-to-print first page; blue light of wi-fi too bright Disclaimer: this review is made after only 3-weeks of ownership/use.",4943
"Clearly future issues could arise which would influence this review if they were to be known in advance.",4944
"First, began researching for new inkjet all-in-one printer about 3-months ago to replace older HP 7520 (good printer by the way - didn't have issues with it).",4945
"While my subscription to CU strongly suggested another HP (same model line as my outgoing printer, but a modern one) I opted to look beyond HP.",4946
"The PIXMA 922 is a recommended printer in CU's ratings.",4947
"What I found when I went looking for customer reviews was I saw more issues with things like jamming and ink issues with the HP and Epson printers that were in my final round of choices.",4948
"I found less of these reports amongst consumers for the 922 and its predecessor.",4949
"Let's get the what's not so great issues out of the way first.",4950
"I don't need a nightlight.",4951
"Can anyone make an electronic device with a blue LED light that doesn't light up a whole room at night?",4952
"It seems to be the nature of things these days with all sorts of consumer electronics.",4953
"Second, the software installation could have been better.",4954
"While I like the idea of installing the latest software right up front (the included CD directs your computer to the Canon website and doesn't install software directly from the CD, which may then need to be updated) the installation process was a bit slow and less than enlightening.",4955
"There were a number of separate applications which could be installed, but very little information provided about what they were, what they did and why I might need them installed.",4956
"In the end I wound up searching the web for descriptions and taking a guess at whether or not I really wanted or needed the specific software.",4957
"For me personally I only need the software/drivers that make the thing work..",4958
"I don't need picture software, etc.",4959
"It would be nicer if they set-up the software installation into two groups: one that just makes the all-in-one work (print, scan, copy, fax, etc.) and another group containing 'extras'.",4960
"Third in the not so great section is a WTF moment...",4961
"at the end of the installation it asked if I wanted to be part of a plan that would send to Canon user information to better help them understand my usage of the all-in-one.",4962
"I normally don't opt into these things anyway, but I'm not opposed to them on principal.",4963
"But this time they wanted to collect information for something like 10-years.",4964
"Absurd.",4965
"A real turn off.",4966
"If they really want to get my opinion and usage information why don't they e-mail me for it on a regular basis?",4967
"They have my e-mail after I register the product and that would seem to be a less intrusive route.",4968
"Lastly, the main paper tray seems flimsy to me.",4969
"Like it should be treated carefully.",4970
"And there isn't any real backplate to it so paper installed in the tray doesn't really sit squeezed into place.",4971
"It may work just fine for all I know in the long-term, but it doesn't exude confidence.",4972
"However, there is plenty I find to like about this all-in-one and thus far I'm very happy with my selection.",4973
"It was well packaged: safe and secure.",4974
"Set-up of the physical device was easy, straight-forward and the printed guide clear and concise.",4975
"Everything went together smoothly.",4976
"The software, once my choices were made, has worked as it should and I really appreciate the ability to initiate a scan from my computer (one of those features my previous printer couldn't do).",4977
"Regarding the actual functions I have tried everything except the faxing part as I don't have a phone line for such.",4978
"The copy, scan and print functions all work as they should.",4979
"The document feeder works as advertised (both sides), but I haven't yet tried two-sided printing.",4980
"A paper saver to be certain, but I think there is probably where folks run into the issue of jamming more than anywhere else.",4981
"Originally printing on standard copier paper (like I use with my HP laser printer) I found the quality of the text and graphics to be such as they usually are on standard copier paper: ok at best.",4982
"I did run out and purchase a higher quality (HP brand - go figure) inkket-oriented paper, which I have used in the past to much better results; especially with text.",4983
"This different paper helps keep the ink from bleeding into the little valleys that exist on paper.",4984
"It helps keep the text more crisp looking and a 500-page ream for $8 is quite reasonable and I highly recommend purchasing such.",4985
"While I have a dedicated picture printer I will make use of this 922 as well for quick prints.",4986
"My text prints show generally good quality, but I find the colors (especially red) a bit muted.",4987
"However, there are plenty of possible adjustments which can be made via the software to help get prints to be where you want them.",4988
"This was not possible on my previous HP printer and I very much welcome this addition.",4989
"With some adjustments and fiddling I have every confidence I will be able to get the prints to match my expectations.",4990
"Lastly, time-to-print...",4991
"via wi-fi (I have not made use of any other connectivity option at this time) the printer wakes up and receives the data quickly.",4992
"However, the printer goes through all sorts of machinations before it actually prints the document.",4993
"I know this is common with inkjet printers, but this 922 feels even slower than my much older HP.",4994
"But after the first page is printed and the printer remains awake the time to print any subsequent pages is much, much quicker.",4995
"Clearly quicker than was my older HP.",4996
"The printer gods give th and the printer gods take this away....",4997

"I would recommend this to a friend!",5013
"Outstanding - Only recently purchased but so far, so very good!",5014
"It does take some time to get warmed up and it can sound kind of clunky sometimes, but it's comforting to know that often the sounds you hear are the sounds of the printer heads being cleaned.",5015
"And it shows in the results.",5016
"Great print quality, and consistent operation.",5017
"I would recommend this to a friend!",5018
"Not what we were hoping - We replaced an older canon which we loved.",5019
"This model, although coming with photo paper has issues in grabbing & feeding the paper.",5020

"Demand high print quality I would recommend this to a friend!",5030
"Prints great but challenging to navigate - The printer prints at a great rate of speed and the quality is really very good.",5031

"Great printer for price.",5042
"About me...",5043
"Frequent user, Photo enthusiast I would recommend this to a friend!",5044

What's not so great: does not sync well with android phone and tablet This is my 3rd Canon all in one .As an artist, I like Canon for color accuracy (my main objective).They did make some improvements: paper tray locations and easier access to ink.",5045
"Very similar to my MX882, so I didn't have to learn a whole new machine.",5046
"However, there are downfalls: slow printing, does not sync well with printing from Samsung Galaxy 4 phone or tab 3 .",5047
"You need to use Google cloud for that.",5048
"If you have iphone/ipad,then no problem.",5049

"But, everything functions well.",5079
"I will likely never use the WiFi option, so I did not set that up.",5080
"Initial setup was a breeze and only took a few minutes.",5081
"The printer is a bit heavier and bulkier than I imagined, but each function does require its own operating space.",5082
"I love the individual print cartridges.",5083
"The only down side of this printer is the amount of time it takes to print or copy the first page.",5084
"It will ""warm up"" for an unusually long time, but after the first print, the rest come at a normal pace.",5085
"I would recommend this to a friend!",5086

"I needn't have worried.",5094
"This printer is definitely a step up from my previous Pixma despite it's low price, and I couldn't be more pleased!",5095
"The only downside is that it takes a surprisingly long time to warm up and to print - you don't want to have to print anything if you are in a hurry.",5096

"Takes a while to warm up though when you first go to print something.",5253
"Photos are excellent quality I would recommend this to a friend!",5254
"Value for your money - This is generally a basic e-printer with scanning & faxing capacity, and for the $100 that we paid, I'd say it's worth the money.",5255
"It does not waste paper because it stores fax confirmation info and you'd print it only when you need it.",5256

"Other than that, it works very quick and fairly quite.",5261
"Easily prints both sides of a paper and excepts heavy weight paper types.",5262
"The reason I picked this model was because it will print on specially surfaced CD's .",5263
"It has a number of features that I have not used yet which makes it even a better value.",5264

"Fantastic!",5274
"- Bought to be an all around office and home printer about 6 months ago and have had zero issues.",5275
"AirPrint works great every time, wifi connection to other home computers still works (unlike previous Epson that started disconnecting 2 months in), and print quality on docs & photos is perfect.",5276
"Very much recommend!",5277
"Very Loud - This product is very loud when in use and it took like 2 minutes to warm up when I just wanted to print something pretty quickly.",5278
"It is also very bulky, don't be fooled by the pics that seem to make it look small.",5279
"It also didn't seem very user friendly to me, but those are in my opinions.",5280
"I don't recommend it to anyone.",5281
"Decent for the price - I have always owned Canon printers, the MX922 all in one is a fine printer for the price.",5282
"The only drawback is the 1) loud auto release drop down of the paper tray, and 2) not supplying a separate paper feed guide for loading photo paper that would eliminate the use of a cassette tray.",5283
"All in all, the print quality is great, and the WiFi and fax features work effortlessly.",5284

"Slow - Printer takes time to warm up and is slower than other printers I have owned No, I would not recommend this to a friend.",5292
"These printers generally only last about 3 years - This is my third Canon MX printer.",5293
"I choose Canon printers because they work seamlessly with Apple products, and they look good.",5294
"That being said, my last two, an MX822 and MX892, only lasted about 3 years until they abruptly went dead...I'm beginning to think Canon does this on purpose.",5295
"The MX922 is working just fine now, but I don't expect it to last more than 3 years, unfortunately, which is why I am giving it an average rating.",5296
"Other than that, so far, I can tell the MX922 is sucking down the ridiculously priced ink fast for the amount I print.",5297
"I have also noticed the color cartridge levels declining as fast as the black cartridges even though I print ""black only"" about 99% of the time...I mostly print out black and white shipping labels and black and white invoices these days.",5298
"I liked my MX892 better because I could load paper in one of two trays, the front or the back.",5299
"I could keep an 8.5x11 sheet of labels in the rear tray, and regular paper in the front tray.",5300
"With the MX922, there is only one tray that accepts regular size paper.",5301
"The other tray is for small size photo paper or something, utterly useless in my opinion, a terrible decision on the part of Canon.",5302
"Good Product for the price - I like the quality of print and ease of set-up.",5303
"Size it a bit big.",5304
"I like the neat design.",5305
"Canon Printer great on colors - Canon - PIXMA MX922-This printer is my 4th Canon printer and 3rd all in one.",5306

"Great all purpose home printer/fax/copier - Excellent product-it has been easy to operate, has great color, and has been reliable.",5314
"I used to be only an HP person, but I really like this Canon product, especially the multiple color cartridges, which allow for easy replacement and reduce cost.",5315
"I would recommend this to a friend!",5316
"Pleased with quality and ease of operation - Previously bought an Epson Workforce and was extremely unsatisfied with the quality of pictures.",5317
"Delighted that the Canon prints CDs and DVDs.",5318
"And the quality of the pictures is astounding.",5319
"Could not be happier.",5320
"Good all in one - Only given 4 stars because of its bulk and size, plus it shakes more than I thought it would during use.",5321
"Otherwise fine.",5322
"I would recommend this to a friend!",5323
"A really nice printer. - Really easy to set up.",5324
"Like all printer manufactures they make their money on the ink so it only comes with the minimum amount before you have to spend another bundle on ink.",5325
"I like being able to print from all my devices.",5326
"Would like it to have the brushed finish instead of the glossy as it shows finger prints.",5327
"I would recommend this to a friend!",5328
"Good printer, but... - Mixed feelings about this printer, my second purchase of the same model.",5329
"It's large, very slow, sucks down the ink, and doesn't seem to scan multiple pages into one document--making each page its own file.",5330
"On the good side, the print is good, the scan is accurate, paper and ink loading is easy, adjusting sizes is easy on prints and pictures.",5331
"Eventually you can get the wifi to work so no cable is needed, and you can get the printer including ink for $100 so it's affordable to start.",5332
"I had the Pixma MX 892 prior to this and it lasted 1 year with only light use, then error B200 appeared on screen and it quit working, even after I cleaned the printhead.",5333
"It refuses to tell you what's wrong, just says go to service center.",5334
"Since repairs are as costly as a new printer, gave up and bought a second MX 922 so I can at least use the same ink cartridges in them.",5335
"Only time will tell if this one performs very long?",5336
"No, I would not recommend this to a friend.",5337
"nice pictures - This is a good printer if you only print for personal use, and not very often.",5338
"The picture quality is nice and it faxes fast.",5339
"THe only issue I have is that it takes a long time from pressing the print button to getting the actual paper.",5340
"I can print, then go do a small task and then come back and the paper will just be beginning to print.",5341
"I would recommend this to a friend!",5342
"Great printer - Only problem with start up was when printing pic from my iPhone it would go directly to the top tray where I could only print on reduced size paper.",5343
"Once I got help from the internet it works great, but felt the start up instructions should have dealt with this.",5344
"I would recommend this to a friend!",5345
"Good printer for the price. - Coming from an HP printer I bought a few years ago I can say this is a huge improvement.",5346
"It's way more cost efficient when it comes to ink.",5347
"The boot time is quite quick.",5348
"The UI is easy to move through.",5349
"The paper tray(s) can hold a decent amount of paper.",5350
"My only gripe is the paper sometimes doesn't load sometimes but it's no big deal.",5351
"The other printer had the same problem but it was much worse.",5352
"Overall I recommend this printer.",5353
"I would recommend this to a friend!",5354
"Slow printer - Nice looking all-in-one printer but very slow...uiet",5355
"Easy to install - I would give this a 5 star, but I do not like the fact that all ink jet printers eventually fill their waste tank (which most people do not know about) and stop working.",5356
"It costs too much to replace the tank, and they end up in the landfill.",5357
"Other than that, this is a good printer.",5358
"It installs easy if you follow the instructions in the setup instruction manual.",5359
"I have mine on a wired network and it assigned an IP and was easily found.",5360
"The speed is decent.",5361
"The only down fall I could see so far is that when you want to print envelopes, you have to remove the paper in the tray and load envelopes.",5362
"It isn't a big deal, but it has two trays.",5363
"It would have been nice if the second tray had an envelope option.",5364
"When aligning the print head after first install, load the special paper in the bottom tray (which is not as noticeable as the middle tray).",5365
"The bottom tray loads regular paper and the mid tray seems to be for smaller papers (photo paper size).",5366
"I wish the mid tray had more paper size options.",5367
"Not as good as I expected - This is the 3rd Canon I've owned.",5368
"Read all the reviews and it seemed like another great printer from Canon.",5369
"But it is only a decent printer at best.",5370
"They moved the paper trays to the front, again not a bad idea, but they put a drop down paper eject tray right above them.",5371
"In order to fill the trays, you must close this drop down and if you forget to put it back down before printing, it violently and loudly puts itself back down.",5372
"Just waiting for it to break.",5373
"It takes the thing sometimes a full 2 to 3 minutes to ""warm up"" before printing if it has sat for more than a couple hours.",5374
"If you do use 8.5 x 11 photo paper that will go in the regular paper tray, you can only put them in one at a time.",5375
"If you put more than that they will all try to pull through the printer together.",5376
"And it is not a quiet printer by any means.",5377
"Not very fast printing either.",5378
"Mediocre design by Canon to say the least.",5379
"Disappointed.",5380
"It works for what we need - Besides lacking a rear document feeder, this has at least the same functionality as the printer its replacing, the mx822, which was a fairly decent printer.",5381
"I haven't tried all the bells and whistles, but it does print from my ""smart"" phone, which it turns out is pretty handy.",5382
"Great printer for home use - This printer is a great combination of quality and value.",5383
"It was relatively easy to set up on my home network, both wired and wireless, and the ink cartridges were easy to install.",5384
"Also, the printer does not use as much ink as the HP printer it replaced.",5385
"The only negative is that the paper tray has to be manually pulled out to see how much paper remains and to load paper.",5386
"I would recommend this to a friend!",5387
"Decent printing quality - Printing quality is good.",5388
"Could use some improvements in the ""user-friendly"" category",5389
"ok - Did not like all the controls attached to the printer lid.",5390
"Returned.",5391

"THAT WAS EASY in comparison to the TERRIBLE AND COMPLICATED set up and operation of this printer.",6137
"Nothing is sequential, it is poorly written and once you are done - ""error found could not complete installation"" so then FOR A $120 PRINTER you have to actually call ""technical support"" as if you had a $20,000 plotter.",6138

"In the 1990s, a prominent competitor reigned, and Canon products had problems.",6184
"Around the turn of the century, this completely reversed.",6185
"Now, Canon printers provide high reliability and overall quality, and Canon's technical support (by Americans in the USA) is extremely helpful, courteous, and simply a pleasure to deal with.",6186
"Even out of warranty, support sessions are quite inexpensive and productive.",6187
"I rank Canon at the very top of technical support operations.",6188
"In addition to my own MX922, I support four other Canons in this product line, all owned by family, one of which is also an MX922.",6189
"I have found this printer to be reasonably fast, reasonably color-accurate for a multifunction printer, and quite reliable.",6190
"Printouts of text and images are very good.",6191
"This unit is feature-rich, and its support of the Airprint standard is a strong plus.",6192
"Regarding negative experiences by other users: Sometimes printer drivers must be re-installed due to file corruption; this is not difficult with the MX922, once one understands that it always should be done from Canon's web site, where one obtains the latest drivers.",6193
"In addition, there may be any of several problems that may have occurred with a particular network, regardless of the brand and model, and/or due to operator error.",6194
"The software has been changed from previous models, and I am still getting used to it--it seems to be less intuitive.",6195
"The MX922 works well both wirelessly and wired.",6196
"And here is a caution: when installing the printer, you must choose to set it up as a wired OR a wireless printer--not both.",6197
"If you wish to change this setting, you must go to the web site and download the printer driver again, choosing the mode to which you wish to change it.",6198
"Since I already have a wireless router, I chose wired, which offers the best of both worlds (the router handles connectivity to the wireless devices).",6199
"Wireless is always going to be a bit less reliable than wired, due to its inherent limitations.",6200
"Paper handling is excellent.",6201
"Yet, an annoying ""feature"" is that although there is a second paper tray, it does not handle envelopes.",6202
"One must empty the main cassette, insert the envelopes, print, and then return the cassette to the paper you usually use.",6203
"One thing to check: at least one of these units had print quality set at ""high"" initially.",6204
"This caused very slow operation.",6205
"If you are experiencing very slow printouts, even after the head-cleaning process (which takes time), check to see that ""Print Quality"" is set at ""Standard"" and that ""Quiet Settings"" are set at ""Do not use quiet mode.""",6206

"Considering all of this printer's features, its size is not out of bounds by any means.",6215
"I have read complaints about Faxing.",6216
"Bear in mind that faxing over phone lines is always going to be a frustration due to the limitations of the phone service.",6217
"Most users have shifted to scanning images and sending them as email attachments.",6218
"The advantages are much improved resolution and fewer mess-ups.",6219
"With most ISPs offering adequate bandwidth and with typically a 20 MB limitation on messages, why would one choose fax except for documents that would exceed the 20 MB limit (for which there are other solutions anyway)?",6220
"The very small ink cartridges do indeed require frequent replacement to support average use.",6221
"This, unfortunately, comes under the moniker of ""the razor blade marketing model"": sell the basic product at cost or a slight loss, and make the profits on supplies.",6222
"This is the factor resulting in a rating of four stars rather than five.",6223
"Yet, in fairness, the entire printer industry works this way.",6224
"The frequent print head cleaning on this model drains all the inks rather rapidly.",6225
"Since ink cartridges do not last long, you may wish to purchase the XL-style cartridges, which contain more ink.",6226
"I have installed one of these on a MacBook.",6227

"It is terrible at picking up up paper.",6236
"It is impossible to collate print work since it often picks up two or more sheets at a time.",6237
"I have never had a printer do this before.",6238

"This newer one has beautiful printing results, just a little noisy with the heavier card stocks.",6245
"What I don't like is the fact that the lower tray handles all letter sized papers, which means I have to add my heavier stocks on top of the plain paper.",6246
"The second tray, upper, is for 5x7 or 4x6 papers only.",6247
"Unless I'm doing something wrong, that's the way it looks to me!",6248

"Finally called tech support to walk me through the process.",6258
"After another half hour +talking to 2 tech support people, it connected.",6259

"And rather than make a vague assertion that there's some sort of router setting that will fix this issue, if you knew what you were talking about you would describe exactly what option or setting needed to be changed.",6934

"As far as I know there's no way to configure any wifi router to force a wifi session to never expire.",6937
"But maybe I've just always picked the wrong wifi routers.",6938
"So name just one wifi router that supports your mystery feature and point me to the page in the user manual for it.",6939
"Furthermore, I've got other wifi printers on my network which do NOT have this problem.",6940
"So whatever the problem is it's only the MX922 that can't deal with it.",6941
"Why should I have to do something special on my network just for the MX922?",6942
"It's absurd to even suggest such a thing.",6943
"If such a thing were necessary than the MX922 should have a big caveat on the outside of the box so that potential customers would know that the MX922 does play nice with standard wifi routers.",6944
"Furthermore, I have a router between my internal network and my ISP connection but there are NO actual routers between my PCs and any of my wifi connected printers (including the MX922).",6945
"What I have is a couple of wifi APs connected to a 48 port managed switch.",6946
"The switch is the backbone of my internal network and it has an uplink to the outside world via a separate router box.",6947
"So the so called wifi routers are actually wireless switches, and any standard ""routing"" related options or settings (for something link a WAN uplink) are completely irrelevant.",6948
"As far as I know, in order to function correctly, the only dynamic information my network switch and wifi AP boxes need to know is the printer's MAC, its IP address, and which wifi box has an active wifi session with the MX922.",6949
"Now it's true that all switches have limited resources for tracking active MAC addresses and IP addresses.",6950
"So if a connected device is inactive for a long period, its entry will get flushed from the switch's address table.",6951
"BUT there's a simple mechanism call ARP broadcasts (which all ethernet or wifi devices must support) which makes that resource limitation irrelevant.",6952
"If the MX922 doesn't know how to wake up from sleep mode and respond to ARP packets, then it's defective and needs to be fixed.",6953
"You can't rely on my router being able to lock down address table entries just for the MX922.",6954
"Also, my DHCP server (like everyone's DHCP server) has a timer which flushes IP addresses of (inactive) devices that let their DHCP reservations timeout.",6955
"So it's the responsibility of the printer to keep track of how long it's DHCP reservation is valid and renew its reservation before expires.",6956
"If the MX922 isn't doing this then it's not really compatible with the IP standards and needs to be fixed.",6957
"If your workaround requires me to configure a static IP address for the MX922 (rather than dynamic DHCP addresses) then the MX922 is a non-compliant device which I do not want on my network.",6958
"And finally, because I'm using the MX922 via wifi (rather than wired), if the printer just goes to sleep and stops responding to packets from the AP it's connected to, then its wifi session WILL expire and there's no way to reach it from any PC on my network.",6959
"Even if I could override my router and force the session to never expire, if the MX922 doesn't know when to wake up and send the right packets to keep the wifi session active, the MX922 also isn't going to be able to wake up at the right time to accept my print job.",6960
"The 802.11 wifi spec clearly spells out how a device is supposed to keep it's session active (even when it enters sleep mode).",6961
"If the MX922 doesn't automatically wake up from sleep mode at the right time and maintain the wifi session, then that's a bug in the MX922.",6962
"It's not something that you can misleading assert is caused by my wifi router disconnecting from the MX922 because I didn't use it frequently enough.",6963
"Clearly, the wifi spec says that it's the responsibility of the connected station (ie the MX922) to keep the wifi session active and if it' doesn't do the right thing then my wifi router is doing the right thing by disconnecting it.",6964
"It's not a ""feature"".",6965
"It's a requirement of the wifi spec.",6966
"I disabled DRX and hard coded the IP address on the printer.",6967
"I also reserved that IP address (using the hardware address of the printer) in my router's DHCP configuration for good measure.",6968
"My printer now responds when I send it a print job without having to restart the printer.",6969

"This Canon printer, however?",7251
"I love it.",7252
"Printed everything from photographs to two-sided documents flawlessly.",7253
"The fact that canon is using a dye ink system on this model instead of a suspended pigment system also means a *lot* less ink is used to print.",7254
"Even printing a full-page photograph on regular office paper didn't leave the paper with that wrinkled wet look.",7255
"I also love the fact that a full-page print actually means FULL page, no white border space left.",7256
"The separate upper tray for smaller photographic paper is handy as well.",7257
"I've printed approximately 150 pages worth of documents and pictures since the date of purchase, and the estimated ink levels on the 'starter' ink it comes with are still at about 80% across the board, except for the yellow which is almost full.",7258

"I recently replaced my PIXMA MX9870 with this model.",7331
"The main reason I upgraded was to use duplex printing easily and to use AirPrint to print from my iPad and iPhone.",7332
"This printer handles these two tasks easily.",7333
"BUT, what I have given up is the ability to print No 10 envelopes easily.",7334
"To print these, you need to unload the paper from the lower paper tray, insert your No 10 envelopes and adjust the guides, then print.",7335
"After printing envelopes, you need to unload the envelopes from the paper tray and reload paper adjusting the guides back.",7336
"There appears to be no error message that even reminds you to change the paper in the tray from envelopes to paper and vice versa.",7337
"In addition, printing addresses on Christmas envelopes is not possible as the envelope paper is a little thicker than the No 10 envelopes, so the Christmas envelopes jam in the printer.",7338
"The reason that printing envelopes is more difficult or not do-able is that Canon has eliminated the rear paper tray.",7339
"There is a second front paper tray, but you can not use it for No 10 envelopes or thicker envelopes.",7340
"Talking to Canon, it appears that all of their current models do not print envelopes easily or allow for printer a thicker envelope for cards.",7341

"I upgraded over one of the 500 series Canon printers and this is definitely a huge improvement.",7351
"My only complaint about wireless printers is how long a printing job takes.",7352
"They seem to do a lot of idling and whatnot before the actual product comes out.",7353
"Other than that, this is fully featured and high quality.",7354
"As a person who scans nearly every important document and stores in cloud storage, having something capable of scanning with ease is very important to me.",7355
"I would absolutely buy this again if I was in the market for another printer.",7356
"My 500 series (can't remember exact model) lasted me almost 5 years and I expect this one to last just as long if not longer.",7357
"I can't recommend this enough.",7358
"Good printer - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) It works well.",7359
"I use it as my second printer.",7360
"It's just very noisy.",7361
"and it sucks ink like a Hoover - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) Noisy, takes forever to actually print anything, the machinery keeps churning well after it's done printing, and it sucks ink like a Hoover.",7362
"Probably not any worse than any other printer, but kind of disappointing.",7363
"Print quality is good when it does print.",7364
"Great....at first until b200 error. - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) I loved it and it worked great for a couple years.",7365
"It used a lot of ink, took forever to start, and was noisy (which I knew about from many reviews but bought anyway), but the features were nice.",7366
"THEN it had its b200 error code a few weeks ago, so I went online and resolved it without any interaction with Canon.",7367
"I'm not going to ship my printer to Canon to have them fix it; a new printer would be cheaper!",7368
"Another b200 error code today.",7369

"Nothing works, won't power on at all.",7372
"Someone online with the same problem suggested that their's had overheated and turned itself off.",7373
"I only had it on for a moment without printing anything.",7374
"DEAD.",7375
"Shopping on Amazon today for a non-Canon replacement, and HP and Epson have similar printers with the same features, including ADF since I do a fair amount of document scanning.",7376

"The dreaded Canon 6000 error for which there seems to be NO FIX.",7384
"I printed on set of ink cartridges for over $100 for maybe 100 or 200 pages of printouts.",7385
"What a piece of garbage and total waste of money.",7386
"NOT FOR NETWORKING - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) Doesn't maintain network connectivity.",7387
"After installing--and linking to network, as evidenced by printing from 2 different computers 50 ft. apart--the printer lost connectivity 3 times in the 3 weeks I had it.",7388
"Each time involved 1-3 hours on the phone with Canon technical support in ""uninstalling"" and ""re-installing"" the printer.",7389
"Did it again Saturday AM and I packed it for return and went to Office Depot where I purchased an HP Office Jet 8610 that installed quickly and painlessly...and it's still up and ""on the job"" 48 hours later.",7390
"Three Stars - Prints ok but is a little noisy and sometimes takes a little extra time to start printing.",7391
"Five Stars - Love this printer.....easy to use....is also a fax machine.......Canon is awesome to work with when you have any questions!!!!!",7392
"Pixma MX922 a good choice. - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) Very happy with printer but disappointed it doesn't connect to my iPhone.",7393
"A bit noisy and sometimes slow to start but then fast to print in both black and white and color.",7394
"Has 4 ink cartridges which could be expensive to replace.",7395
"Don't believe the dimensions - This printer is not really 15.6"" deep.",7396
"With the paper tray closed, that is the depth, but to print, the whole front of the printer is dropped open, and a little arm swings out.",7397
"So when you're using the printer, it is more like 23"" deep.",7398
"Otherwise, the printer seems pretty typical.",7399
"Call Canon for help - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) I've been reading reviews here about people having trouble setting up their wi fi.",7400
"I did too at first.",7401
"Do not use the WPS set up.",7402
"Instead set it up on the printer in the setup menu for wifi where you enter your wifi password.",7403
"But if you don't know how to do this, call Canon!",7404
"I did, and a very nice lady talked me right through it.",7405
"If you just purchased your printer this service is free so just pick up the phone and call and also you get connected to someone in the U.S. (Not overseas).",7406
"Another hint for people saying their printer didn't last long - you have to use it!",7407
"Even if you don't have anything to print just print something every day.",7408
"This keeps the print heads from clogging.",7409
"And for those saying it takes so long to warm up, makes noises, etc. - leave your printer ON all the time.",7410
"Default is for it to go to sleep.",7411
"Go into your settings to leave it on.",7412
"I never turn mine off except when I go away for a few days,etc.",7413
"This really takes very little electricity.",7414
"Hope some of these hints help.",7415
"This is actually the best printer out of the many different brands I have used through the years.",7416
"Not Happy With This Model. - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) I purchased the MX922 to replace a very old HP printer.",7417
"I don't print much and have it hooked direct to my desktop PC via USB (not Wireless).",7418
"No comprehensive owner's manual comes with it, you need to go to the Canon Site to get in depth information regarding features.",7419
"It is also a bit noisier than expected.",7420
"I realize it comes with starter ink but I can't believe within 10 days the Cyan was dry and both Magenta and Yellow were almost depleted.",7421
"Please note I did not print even one picture, only 12 short documents at the most.",7422
"I then purchased from Amazon the Canon CLI-251 BK/CMY 4 PK Value Pack and replaced the three color cartridges, they seem to be holding up thus far.",7423
"This printer cycles way way too much and is very annoying.",7424
"Whether it's on through the PC or I just turn on the switch it behaves the same.",7425
"It turns on and sits there ready to copy, as soon as I hit copy through the PC or on the unit itself it decides it wants to cycle before printing.",7426
"I now have to wait for the cycling to finish before it prints.",7427
"Why it just doesn't cycle when first turned on makes no sense to me.",7428
"The scanner also is a nuisance, I can insert a picture or document onto the scanner bed and tell it to scan using the Canon Scan Utility software.",7429
"Immediately I get the message scanner warming up, I then need to wait for the warm up before it scans.",7430
"OK I can understand that but what's unacceptable is once it finished scanning I can keep the same item in the scanner or place a different one immediately after scan and hit scan again.",7431
"Guess what, the scanner warming message comes up again and I have to wait, how stupid is that?",7432
"Another feature I don't like is when making a copy using the TOP TRAY is that the duplex printing mode is buried down in the menus.",7433
"I wish they would have a button for duplex mode on the printer itself and having the default as single sided.",7434
"If you print in Duplex and forget to change it back to single copy it will retain the duplex mode and take longer to make a copy should you next copy be single sided.",7435
"I also noticed on the Amazon ink I purchased there is no expiration date on it.",7436
"I just emailed Canon and asked if their Pixma retail bought inks have expiration dates, I'm waiting for a reply.",7437
"I like how the printer looks but very unhappy with its constant cycling and over complicated menus.",7438
"I would never buy this model again or recommend it to a friend.",7439
"Edit: Just received an Email from Canon regarding Ink Expiration.",7440
"Thank you for writing to us regarding the PIXMA MX922.",7441
"My name is Shannon and I am eager to answer your questions pertaining to the ink.",7442
"Unopened Canon inks do not have an expiration date.",7443
"However, if the inks are opened, we recommend using them within six months, unless they are installed in the printer.",7444
"By being installed in the printer, the inks are capped off, to avoid them from drying out.",7445
"I have loved all of my previous Canon printers - I have loved all of my previous Canon printers, but can not say that for this Canon pixma 922 printer.",7446
"It is incredibly slow when printing and won't print the complete print job.",7447
"I have also had extreme difficulty getting it to connect wirelessly with my MacBook Pro.",7448
"When this needs replacing, I will be buying a different brand.",7449
"Great mid size printer. - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) This is a nice printer for the price.",7450
"It does lose connectivity, however; if you turn it off then back on your back in business.",7451
"Great mid size printer fits most anywhere.",7452
"Networking nightmare - When it does work it is slow and loud - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) 1 star for poor network connectivity and speed.",7453
"Wireless not working at all and even the wired connection fails continuously.",7454
"Probably in partially due to a software and/or driver bug because the wired connection works most of the time after restarting the software.",7455
"A major pain and a waste of time.",7456
"Wireless capability is a joke.",7457
"I have a very stable LAN with many devices connected without issue for years.",7458
"Has to be the printer.",7459
"I have the latest drivers.",7460
"Very annoying interface on the unit and in the software.",7461
"They make it so difficult to get the manual.",7462
"Insulting.",7463
"And no support.",7464
"When it does work it is slow and loud.",7465
"It's going back tomorrow.",7466
"Hard to find something in this price range that doesn't have 10-20% negative reviews.",7467
"Even the next level up is plagued with issues - Epson and HP included.",7468
"Tried all the forum ""fixes"".",7469
"Offline all the time and does not print wireless from my Chrome Book. - I should have done more homework.",7470
"My Chrome notebook can not hook up to this Canon wirelessly.",7471
"It always says it is offline.",7472
"I've researched online forums for hours finding tons of people with the same problem, tried many ""fixes"" and believe that the IP address when registering the printer with Google (which is preprogrammed into the unit and why I bought it) pulls an IP address.",7473
"That address never matches up again because of all the phones, computers and tablets logged onto our network changing IPs.",7474
"Recommendations are to assign an IP address which I failed to understand how to do and I feel I'm kind of tech savvy.",7475
"One guy I read about spent hours with tech from Google, could not get it to link and finally they determined to use it until the ink runs out and buy a different printer.",7476
"Well said.",7477
"It shouldn't be this hard.",7478
"Good Quality - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) So far so good.",7479
"Reasonably easy set up.",7480

"Easy printing.",7484
"Good quality output.",7485
"The little door opens on it's own -> worth it...unless you use firefox. - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) I love this damn thing, but I gotta give it four stars because my wife bitched about how heavy it is.",7486
"She thinks it is bending the top of her desk and it is kind of heavy, so I don't want to pick it up to figure out if it is.",7487
"The setup took me maybe an hour.",7488
"My wife's computer is hard wired into it because she doesn't use google, but I take advantage of the cloud printing on my desktop and laptop.",7489
"I think the phone feature is cool too, because my wife has needed me to print out things while I'm at work and I could with this gadget.",7490
"Anyway, when you go to print things you gotta be logged into your google account in the chrome browser, so if you use two factor to login on firefox you'll get pissed like I do.",7491
"Then the printing is slightly tedious where it'll ask you where to print and you gotta hit cloud print and then select it.",7492
"This is kind of obvious but frustrating too, that the printer has to be on - it makes sense but I curse the world when I gotta do it -> if I can print wirelessly from the cloud it should have enough sense to turn the damn thing on.",7493
"Ok, so you went through all the frustration and spent the money on this printer and engineers have spent years working and here is the true payoff -> when you go to print, the little door opens by itself for the paper to spit out -> that freaking rules!!!",7494
"I can't remember if it was on amazon, ebay, or 3rd party, but there is super cheap ink that you can get for like $2 a cartridge and it takes multiple.",7495

"Now, 6 months later, it suddenly stopped printing at all even though it still scans..",7505
"I have spent hours on the Canon Troubleshooting website to find drivers, software, information on how to solve the problem, with no luck.",7506
"It takes forever to ""warm up"", uses up the expensive print cartridges in the process, this printer has never been a breeze to use.",7507
"The MX922 worked fine, not great for the random months in the past year that I've owned it.",7508

"That feature does not work for me even from my P C. I did get it to work just one time, but since then, the print stays ready in q at Google and a print is requested up to 8 times.",7536
"Each time a print is requested, my printer responded that it is communicating for about 1 second but never prints anything.",7537
"I tried all of the advice given by searchkng for this problem but find that my need was as an interest in technology rather than my need for it's useful purpose.",7538
"My internet connection speed tests at 7 MBPS with no problems, so I will just wifi print and look for this feature as a hobby to make the next time that my printer runs out of ink and again find that replacement ink costs just slightly less than an entire new printer with ink included.",7539

"There are things about this printer that are truly great and things that I am having a really hard time dealing with.",7553
"So far my biggest issue are the grey tones.",7554
"Printing in greyscale (without color ink) does provide true greys and black but also creates an incredibly pixilated print (especially when set to high quality) Setting it to standard quality smoothes out the picture a bit but also creates thin black horizontal lines across the picture repeating every 7/8 of an inch.",7555
"Printing pictures in color does fix the pixilation issue but then greys are not true.",7556
"Very light greys and blacks are stunning but medium to medium dark greys come out with a warm hue.",7557
"I called canon to report the issue and they didn't seem concerned.",7558
"I was told that I shouldn't be printing in greyscale and that I should always just be printing in color.",7559
"Greyscale will always be a lesser quality.",7560

"After wasting many test prints at her direction trying to prove to me that the printer was perfect she finally agreed to send me a new print head.",7566
"We will see if this fixes my issues.",7567
"I will update when it arrives.",7568
"Now for the good.",7569
"The scanner on this machine is incredible.",7570
"This is the first scanner I have used that catches every small detail and even the most gentle shading of a pencil drawing.",7571
"Even if everything else about this printer was awful I would keep it for the scanner alone.",7572
"Further it prints color photos beautifully and makes RGB to CMYK translations that are so accurate it's amazing. 2 separate paper cassettes make it really convenient to set up for printing photos and documents separately.",7573
"A big feature for me is the print door.",7574
"When not in use it shuts the door hiding all of the working parts behind a door.",7575
"This does a pretty good job of keeping dust out of the machine without the use of a cover.",7576

"It costs $80 to replace toners which I have had to do 3 times in just a little over 5 months.",7580
"It is insane!",7581
"Toners are never on special so there is no opportunity to cut costs that way.",7582

"As always, Canon ink cartridges are not cheap and the ones from my old Canon copier do not work in the new copier.",7586
"Just so you know the ink costs 80. 00 ... - Just so you know the ink costs 80.00 to replace all tanks (at costco).",7587
"It only comes with half the amount of ink.",7588
"And if just one tank runs out you can't use the scanner or any of the other functions at all.",7589
"Wouldn't buy it again.",7590
"Plenty of features, but slow start-up speed - Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (Office Product) It can take quite a while for the printer to 'spin up' to the point where I'm a bit disappointed with the overall time it takes to print.",7591
"While solvable, installing on linux required downloading an additional driver, strangely enough from the non-US division of Canon only.",7592

"My previous, cheaper Canon printer allowed both to be loaded at the same time.",7614
"Bigger than the picture looks.",7615
"Bigger than my Epson WF 600. - It would be easier if they didn't include the crappy instructions.",7616
"Just use the menus on the machine.",7617
"Much easier than trying to install on a network just using the menu on the printer.",7618
"I don't know what Canon is thinking.",7619
"Must have had a guy with only one English course under his belt write installation instructions.",7620

"on the phone that the cost to repair the MX860 would be greater than the cost of a new MX922.",7628
"That may well be true, but the MX922 pales in comparison to the MX860, which was quieter and had features that the MX922 doesn't offer.",7629
"Also, Canon has, regrettably, adopted the Gillette Razor marketing model (sell a razor handle cheaply and charge a fortune for the replacement blades) re: the replacement ink cartridges.",7630
"None of the MX860 ink cartridges fit the MX922 model!",7631

"If you don't use it continuously, it seems to take forever (five minutes, literally) to prep its ink tanks before it will print.",8383
"This has the effect of draining them within a few uses.",8384
"So if you don't print regularly, don't use this model.",8385
"Also, when you try to turn it off, it spends an inordinate amount of time processing the tanks as well before it finally shuts down.",8386
"Otherwise, it is a nice printer.",8387

"After those long conversations...it may work...for a short period of time.",8398
"I was told that my printer was just simply too far away from my wireless router.",8399
"I think this must be their canned excuse when they can't figure it out, because my wireless router is less then 10 feet away.",8400
"I gave up and went back to my trusty Brother MFC that has never failed me.",8401
"I gave it 3 stars because the color printing part is very good.",8402
"Runs through black ink very quickly.",8403
"Very disappointed PIXMA MX 920 series user - I bought 6 months ago and I really regret to get this printer.",8404
"Do not buy it.",8405
"There is no such an advantages of having more cartridges, all finish at the same time so you ended up having to buy and pay more for them that HP.",8406
"But that is nothing compared to the connection to wireless.",8407
"It get easily disconnected it lost the ip address and you can spent hours trying to connect and follow all kind of trouble shouting, and get frustrated because it will not work.",8408

"After sparing use, the ink has run out.",8424
"I tried and make sure to use ""fast"" printing and ""black and white"" for documents, but still the ink has quickly run out.",8425
"The ink is also very expensive to buy.",8426
"If you have kids at home, I'd have a laser printer for printing documents, and use this for scanning and photos.",8427
"Ok for the price - I bought this when my old MX882 finally broke.",8428
"The MX882 was the best multi-function machine I have had, this model is nowhere near as good; it is loud, feels flimsy, has regular paper jams, and takes much longer to actually start printing.",8429
"It appears they tried to keep the price low by dropping the quality.",8430
"Four Stars - Works well.",8431
"Takes a long time to warm up but once it's going, no problems.",8432
"Canon 922: Canon has done much better in the past. - As a Canon user I am very disappointed in this user unfriendly printer: Pros: Good print quality on both color and B&W; large capacity ink cartridges; wireless; prints off of phones, tablets, etc; duplexes quickly; printing is fairly fast; will print on printable CD disks; decent size paper tray, will handle 11X14 (legal) paper for both scanning and printing..",8433
"Cons: large footprint; noisy; fax and scan menus are difficult when compared with my earlier Canon; firmware update information confusing; has lengthy (and probably ink wasting) start up and shut down.",8434
"Really big Con: It takes 12 steps to go from printing sheets to print an envelope and back again!",8435
"It is this last ""Really big Con"" that led to the loss of 2 of the stars as this is an major difficulty in the use of this printer.",8436
"The other cons only account for the loss of 1 star.",8437
"To print an envelope you have to close the output tray, open the lower paper tray, take the paper out, adjust the guides, insert your envelope(s), reinsert the tray, print your envelope, open the output tray (which opened automatically when you printed) remove the paper tray, readjust the paper guides, reinsert the paper, reinsert the paper tray.",8438
"If you're trying to print the envelope for each letter, this process will drive you crazy.",8439
"My previous canon all in one had an easily accessible rear feeder for envelopes and photo pager that was easily accessed..",8440
"It is interesting that you rarely find this mentioned, but for those of us who print envelopes, it is a major problem that should not have happened.",8441
"I will be replacing this printer soon as I noticed the problem after my return period was over (not from Amazon).",8442

"Also goes through ink like crazy.",8449
"Don't really like it. - TOO BIG: The footprint on this printer is very large.",8450
"I'm sure it matches the listed dimensions, but it is BIG.",8451
"PAPER TRAY: The paper tray is on the front and folds up into the machine while not in use.",8452
"The drawback is the sharp and annoying manner in which it snaps open to dispense your completed prints.",8453
"Make sure nothing is on your desk or table in front of it.",8454

"It works like a dream.",8461
"The colors are beautiful and the black is deep and rich.",8462

"We didn't do that and it's a little bit congested on the desk.",8465
"Does the job for a home printer - I've had this two weeks.",8466

"We are happy with it, and the price.",8471
"Complaint.",8472
"It is without question the noisiest printer I have ever had.",8473
"We keep it in a closet in a guest room, so no big deal, but if it was on a desk near me, the noise would really bug me.",8474
"It is also slow, but as a home printer, we don't really care.",8475
"I wouldn't recommend this for a home office because of the noise and slow print.",8476
"Addition: Sherrie White's review of July 1, 2014 really helped me set up properly.",8477
"Aweful!",8478
"- Don't buy it!",8479
"If you get a paper jam, you can not get in there to clear the thing out!!!",8480
"I have never seen such a printer, that allows no access to get a paper jam out of it!",8481
"I would NOT recommend this printer!",8482
"Not worth the money - Not sure if I just got a bad apple or what, but this printer has been nothing but a headache since I took it out the box.",8483
"I can't print more than one page at a time because of paper jams.",8484
"I print one page and bells and whistles go off because it's saying there's a paper jam, but there's no paper in it.",8485

"Was able to send to the printer via iPad but it always went to the wrong paper tray when I tried to print from my iPhone.",8487
"The only thing that function well was the copying feature, but because of the paper jams, that was an annoying process as well.",8488

"On its way back to Amazon!",8496
"- After many frustrating years dealing with HP printers, I decided switch makers and buy the Canon MX922 on the basis of several favorable online comparisons with other printers.",8497
"The price (under $100) was definitely a factor, too.",8498
"I should have read the many negative reviews on Amazon.",8499
"While the printer has many useful features, it falls flat in its most important responsibility - printing a simple document quickly.",8500
"Apparently you DO get what you pay for!",8501
"As others have reported and I will emphatically concur, the cycle from hitting the ""Print"" command on the computer to having a one-page monochrome text-only Word document in hand is excruciatingly long on the first document of the day and unacceptably long on documents printed immediately thereafter.",8502
"I've also had problems with wireless connectivity, even though the printer and MacBook Pro are within 15 feet of the router.",8503
"I made the mistake of buying this for my wife who has no patience with unresponsive technology.",8504

"Would be cheaper to buy a new printer.",8523
"REALLY???",8524
"You can't help me fix it over the phone.",8525
"So this printer is now sitting in my dumpster, and I went out and bought an Epson.",8526
"Will never give money to Canon again, as they basically get your money, and when a product stops working, they are like ""oh well!""",8527

"Works okay - but not for long - This printer did a decent job and died after 14 months of low home office use.",8540
"Same with another Canon all-in-one we had earlier.",8541
"Also true for a Brother all-in-one inkjet.",8542
"They barely live beyond two years.",8543

"She prints A LOT so we needed something that could take over the last Canon we killed after years and years of abuse.",8584
"We have used Epson and HP printers before but nothing lasted nearly as long or as well as our last Canon Pixma.",8585
"Anyways we love the wireless printing, the speed of this thing, and the wireless scanning features.",8586
"It prints fast with high quality and does very well with color.",8587
"I will admit that it is loud (there is a quiet feature to it but we haven't played with it too much).",8588
"You won't want to be printing this if someone is trying to nap in the same room, but it is definitely quiet enough that a person one or two rooms away won't even hear it.",8589
"This is not going to replace a workplace printer that is utilized by 6 or more people on a regular basis but it can handle having a couple of hundred pages being printed out on it on a regular basis.",8590
"Nor will it take the place of a professional color printer.",8591
"From what I've seen so far I trust that it will last as long as our last Canon printer (about 6 years) with very high usage and the punishing abuse of an author.",8592

"No indication at all.",8601
"So, I googled it.",8602
"The guy doing the video gave a warning that the first step was the WPS button, which Canon gives NO INSTRUCTIONS on where it is.",8603

"Excellent Print, Flawed Setup Process - Printer prints great, good quality and dries almost instantly.",8607
"I love the auto print on back feature, and ink life is good running on the XL cartridges.",8608

"won't ever consider buying ANY other canon products - and i'm a photographer...",8618
"So far, a mixed bag of experiences - I bit large foot print wise, but impressive in the range of functions it provides.",8619
"A bit slow on the print side, but, the resulting quality is very, very nice.",8620
"The CD/DVD label printer has taken some time to figure out, but the end result is nothing short of awesome.",8621
"The biggest issue I'm faced with now is in how the printer is set to print 2-sided copy at 100% original size and spits out half pages with both pages being on a single side.",8622
"The Canon web site is difficult and cumbersome.",8623
"Not the easiest of multi-function machines to operate, yet still way ahead of other units at or above this units sale price.",8624
"total waste of money - It is connected to the net but can three different computers are unable to connect to it.",8625

"I will never buy another Canon product again, total waste of money.",8627

"I have done cleans, deep cleans, checked the inks manually, and replaced inks.",8640
"Nothing seems to fix these correctly.",8641
"It also seems I have the most trouble if I don't print with all the colors weekly.",8642
"The cleans and the deep cleans don't seem to do anything.",8643
"I really do hope Canon gets their stuff together on their printers, because I do believe they can make great products, but so far my experience with their printers has not been good.",8644
"I probably won't buy another Canon printer until I hear that they made new models, fixed all the old problems, and have been called amazing from 10 people.",8645
"Only OK, with two flaws that make me want a different printer. - This printer is attractive and sleek.",8646
"It's also pretty easy to set up.",8647
"Text and photos come out looking nice and clean.",8648
"I've found it lacking in two critical, for me, areas.",8649
"One is that the paper trays are very flimsy, they feel as though they're going to break every time I pull one out to reload paper.",8650
"The front panel drops down when a page is printed, this panel also feels flimsy and has broken so that it no longer releases automatically when a job is sent to the printer.",8651
"We have to manually drop the front panel before every print job.",8652
"The second weak area is the paper handling of photo paper.",8653
"It misfeeds when we put more than one sheet of photo paper in the tray.",8654
"The means we print one photo, wait for it to print, then reload another single sheet and send another photo to the printer.",8655
"The next time this printer runs out of ink we're going to buy another printer instead of spending the $60 for a complete set of ink cartridges.",8656

"Plus....it's huge.",8671
"My husband ordered it...not me...and so I didn't have a say but it is just too big for an everyday printer.",8672
"The worst part is it uses up the ink way too quickly.",8673

"Although a bit heavy, it prints well and the ... - Although a bit heavy, it prints well and the wireless works cleanly.",8675
"However, there is one major drawback - there are five print cartridges.",8676
"There is a large black, three color, and a small black for photos.",8677
"Although I print exclusively in black and white, the printer insists on using the color cartridges for some unknown reason.",8678
"They run out quickly, being small, and are expensive to replace.",8679
"This is an expensive downside - I am always replacing color cartridge that I do not need or use.",8680
"Further, the printer refuses to print at all when any of the cartridges is empty, forcing you to go replace the cartridge you don't want and don't need.",8681
"Very irritating and expensive.",8682
"Do Not Buy!",8683
"- Uses too much ink!!",8684

"Bad board so sent a replacement and it works great.",9700
"Good support by Canon.",9701
"PIXMA MX922 Is Improvement Over MX870 - I have only had the printer up and running for about 10 days so I haven't been able to use all the feathers yet.",9702
"So here are my comments on what I've experienced so far.",9703
"I am a school teacher and I use the Pixma MX922 primarily for school work, such as printing out lesson plans, assessments, pictures on occasion, etc.",9704
"The ADF is a necessary feature because I often scan multiple pages into a single PDF and it's so much easier with the ADF.",9705
"I used to have an MX870 and the MX922 copying feature is lightning fast compared to the older model.",9706
"I'm so glad they were able to speed it up.",9707
"I am able to copy 60 pages on the MX922 in the same time it took me to copy 8 pages with the MX870.",9708
"I like how the loading of the ink cartridges was moved to the front of the printer.",9709
"I miss the numeric keypad to type in large numbers when making multiple copies.",9710
"But, by holding down the plus (+) key after it gets past 10 it will jump by 10 digits (to 20, 30, 40, etc.) so that is a nice workaround.",9711
"Color photo printing is also a step above the MX870.",9712
"The colors are true and sharp.",9713
"One design that I don't care for is how the paper is caught after it is printed.",9714
"When the door is opened the ""paper output support"" folds out and you are encouraged to extend it.",9715
"The support is 2 1/8"" wide and the extension is only 1 1/4"" wide and very flimsy.",9716
"When printing multiple pages the printer shoots them out so fast that each page slides toward the end of the support, and after about 8 or so pages the paper slides off the end of the support and on to the floor.",9717
"However, this is a minor flaw compared to the major increase in print and copy speed.",9718
"The only other minor quibble I have is that the finish on the housing of the printer is a ""dust magnet"" and even a Swiffer has a difficult time removing all the dust.",9719
"Overall the quality of the performance of the printer far outweighs the minor inconveniences mentioned above.",9720
"Works well so far - Before this printer I had an Epson 2200 that worded great for many years.",9721
"When it broke down I got another Epson printer, an XP800.",9722
"This latter device was the biggest lemon ever.",9723
"I kept it for 12 months.",9724
"Epson sent me 3 new printers and innumerable ink cartridges to try to unclog the print heads.",9725
"Tech support was terrible and did not allow me to give any feedback.",9726
"When the Epson XP 800 clogged once again a month ago in utter frustration I took a hammer and smashed the device into pieces and threw it in my dumpster.",9727
"Once upon a time EPSON PRINTERS seemed to work ok but the recent models (pro and consumer) clog all the time.",9728
"Since I have a large format 44"" Canon ipf 8300 and it has been good I CONSIDERED SWITCHING TO CANON AGAIN.",9729
"I found good reviews about this Canon printer and bought it.",9730
"So far it has worked great for me.",9731
"When you send a print job it does several cleaning and paper cycling routines which take a bit of time but after the first print job it seems to be fast.",9732
"The inks are expensive but all inks are expensive - this is the way these companies make money.",9733
"Great printer - I had a canon printer for 3 years and it's still functioning but I decided to try new printer and I bought an Epson but it lasted only for 6 months and it was replaced under warranty but also the second one is malfunctioning now.",9734
"Then I decided to go back to canon with this printer and I hope it lasts longer.",9735
"So far it is the best but it is very heavy and bulky.",9736
"Good so far - We haven't used this printer a whole lot.",9737
"In addition, I've read that it can have problems connecting wirelessly (e.g., coming out of ""sleep""); and I had an Ethernet cable handy, so I've connected it that way.",9738
"In short, it hasn't exactly been stress-tested.",9739
"That said, for what we've done with it, it has been perfect.",9740
"The most impressive thing so far is a scan and print of an 8x10 color photo.",9741
"The results were excellent The photo included some complex colors in the background, and they were rendered fairly accurately.",9742
"The flesh tones and more important aspects were even better.",9743
"My least-favorite thing about the printer has been installation.",9744
"We have 7 computers, so any nuisance is magnified.",9745
"It wasn't bad, I just felt like it could be quicker and easier to be sure you were doing the right thing.",9746
"I needed the installation disk for PCs, was able to just find it on the network and connect to it (with appropriate drivers automatically installed correctly) with our 2 Macs.",9747
"I also don't love its software--I don't like anything that wants to live on the desktop, let alone something taking up a significant amount of real estate.",9748
"Finally, I hate the idea of heavy maintenance ink usage.",9749
"Consumer Reports says that will be an issue, but we haven't had it long enough for me to verify that.",9750
"(In case you're wondering why I would buy this printer given that, I felt like wasted ink would be the lesser of evils vs. issues/problems Consumer Reports noted with other printers.)",9751
"If I could give it 4.5 stars, I would.",9752
"But since it has some flaws, though small, I'm giving it a 4 instead of a 5.",9753
"Like it so much I purchased three so far. - This works to my liking, even though it is sometimes slow in getting started to print, but the print is clear, photos are good, the colors are good and my first one is still going strong after two and a half years of daily use.",9754
"If you need Canon support, they are the greatest.",9755
"Thanks.",9756
"Great home use all in one device!",9757
"- Used for light printing, scanning and fax in a home.",9758
"I have not yet tried printing pictures but paper print quality is great.",9759
"I like the wi-fi capabilities and scan right to the pc over wi-fi.",9760
"Printer was much easier to setup and so far more reliable than my fried HP8500, however I like the paper feeder better on the HP.",9761
"Pixma on Ubuntu - This is a good all around printer.",9762
"If you are using Windows, everything works easily out of the box.",9763
"It also works well with Android cell phones with a free app. I was able to set up the wireless printer on Ubuntu 12.04 using drivers from Canon Europe web site but the scanner still doesn't connect to Ubuntu computer wirelessly.",9764
"Great, but slow - Like my last Canon printer, this one is robust and works like a charm.",9765
"My only concern is that with a high number of pages (like more than 5) it seems to move slowly, at times pausing for long moments.",9766
"Don't like it!",9767
"- It prints nicely, but the thing sometimes takes 60 seconds going through some sort of gyrations before it prints.",9768
"Then it goes through another 60 seconds of the same thing when it stops.",9769
"Also, wait until you mess up the scan settings menu.",9770
"Good luck.",9771
"Now I have to scan each page one at a time and combine the resulting pdf's.",9772
"Well Designed and Well Built - I bought this to primarily replace an old Epson used mostly for CD/DVD label printing.",9773
"This Canon not only far surpasses the Epson in this regards, but also gives sharper text for regular printing jobs compared to all of my other newer printers.",9774
"Haven't tried its full capabilities yet, but feel confident that this will be the best printer I've ever owned.",9775

"Canon has solid printers but the ink is so expensive!",10541
"I wish best Buy would have ink specials and notify me!",10542
"Thanks!",10543
"This is my second Canon MX922 Printer.",10544
"The previous one was over 2 years old.",10545
"I had replaced the print head in it once and it needed to be replaced again.",10546
"The price on the new MX922 was cheaper than a new print head so I bought the new printer instead.",10547
"It is a good printer however it is a little noisy and goes thru a lot of sequencing sometimes before printing.",10548
"Canon printers get excellent reviews, including from repair techs.",10549
"I purchased this one and anticipate I'll like it, but have minor concerns over how easily and cheaply I'll be able to buy cartridges.",10550
"There are some odd features on this printer, and it's noisy, but the color and crispness are excellent.",10551
"While a great price and a good printer, it should certainly last more than 3 years, and this one broke 2 months shy of that.",10552
"Called Canon service line and it couldn't be fixed over the phone.",10553
"Because of the expense of fixing it I'm forced to throw it out and buy a new one.",10554
"Seems like a terrible waste, and good brands like Canon should last considerably longer.",10555
"Takes a little longer than I'd like to get started, but so far I would recommend this printer.",10556
"Good printer, does printing and scanning , but I wish manufacturers, all of them not just Canon, would makes things super simple so my grandma could do the setup in 3 clicks or less.",10557
"I'm no dummy and they had good instructions enclosed, yet somewhere the instructions deviated from what was really necessary and I could not do it.",10558
"There are different file names and different applications, etc etc, Jesus WAY to complicated.",10559
"Just I want to plug it in and do click , click , DONE.",10560
"To Canon's credit I was able to get a real person on the phone to help me.",10561
"Poor Performer - Printer is oriented almost entirely toward printing photos and pictures.",10562
"It has almost no capabilities for printing documents, labels, bank checks or other ""work"" related objects.",10563
"I have had to contact support three times to get the printer to print from a web site, to print reports from a computer program and Adobe formatted documents.",10564
"It still will not print bank checks correctly.",10565
"I have to contact support to get it to print bank checks.",10566
"It is slow to be ready to print, making various unusual sounds.",10567
"It often loses connectivity to my wireless network.",10568
"It has very limited guidance on its screen.",10569
"It is quiet, though.",10570
"I have purchased a dozen of the pixma mx922 printers and installed them for family and friends.",10571
"Just remember when you use off brand cartridges you void your warranty.",10572
"Lately I have had 3 of those printers with a B200 error message so be aware.",10573
"Good printer @ good price, but slow &ink expensive - I had a PIXMA MX860 that I was happy with, but my daughter broke it trying to remove jammed paper.",10574
"I felt comfortable getting another PIXMA so I purchased the MX922 knowing I didn't need the fax, but since I got a price match at a real good price I figured it made sense to make the purchase.",10575
"Best Buy didn't give me any problems with the price match.",10576
"The printer was easy to set up and the installation (and removal) of the ink cartridges is easy.",10577
"The big drawback, as mentioned by many, is that it is slow.....if you want a quick print, it's not gonna happen.",10578
"And if you want the printer to start up quickly, that also is not going to happen.",10579
"But there's always a trade off with price and performance.....maybe there's a better option, but I didn't find it.",10580
"I still need to check the photo printing and comment on that.....",10581
"Returned It - I'm fairly computer literate but after two days of trying, I couldn't get hooked up.",10582
"Packed it up & back to store it went!",10583
"Bought an HP LaserJet color printer which I set up in under 30 minutes.",10584
"Serves it's purpose.",10585
"The only reason for 4 stars is because it claims to print from Google cloud but in order for this to happen the computer with the software must be open so I ended up having to download the Canon app to print from my phone.",10586
"Easy to Get Up and Running Quickly - Although it was quick and easier than any printer I previously have owned to get up and running, I feel like the print quality is more like draft quality.",10587
"Also, the owners manual is only available online and there is no index or table of contents so you have to scroll to find what you are looking for and who is going to print out 200+ pages!?!",10588
"The printer is also larger than I expected and takes up a lot of space.",10589
"I have yet to try to print art, so I don't know how that will turn out on high-quality paper.",10590
"My fingers are crossed for a good result.",10591
"Keep saying no paper - While it has plenty of papers in tray, it keeps complaining about there's no paper.",10592
"Searching on google I found that tons of people has the same issue start from 3 years ago.",10593
"One takeaway is that DO NOT use chrome.",10594
"Although this solve the issue for me, as a big company like CANON this is less satisfying user experience.",10595
"I've had Canon printers for years.",10596
"This is actually the same one I had previously.",10597
"I purchased it again because I had left over cartridges and it was on sale.",10598
"However, its slow, it intermittently looses connection with wifi and won't print wirelessly, the cartridges are expensive and I have broken the extending arm on the front door on both of them.",10599
"This one it only took a day before it broke.",10600
"Good printer!",10601
"Just prints slow. - The printer is large and you can feel the weight.",10602
"Set-up was easy.",10603
"Connecting devices was a breeze.",10604
"Trial cartridges uses up pretty fast.",10605
"I recommend buying the set of cartridges when purchasing.",10606
"Printing is slow.",10607
"Not very slow, but slow.",10608
"Other than that, a good printer.",10609
"Good Printer for the Home - All features have performed as promised.",10610

"Works great - Works great, just not the fastest printer.",10612
"My Hp printer prints 10x's faster.",10613

"It only turns on but all functions have stopped.",10617
"Downloaded recommended software online but still dead.",10618
"I like this printer for all the different things it can do, and do well.",10619
"Only complaint is that I don't believe it is great at photo printing on photo paper, the ink tends to bead up a bit.",10620
"Good quality printer with lots of features.",10621
"However, as with many printers, the software and integration is less than stellar.",10622
"Especially with respect to the scanning function.",10623
"I brought this for my sister and its a little complicated I wish I had got something more easy to use you have to wait long time to get copies not happy with the buy",10624
"Great replacement for our dead Canon 4-in-1 - It was on sale at a great price and very easy to install the wi fi for all of our computers - and I am a computer dummy.",10625
"Was disappointed that I had to buy all new printer cartridges that are different from our previous model.",10626
"Print quality is good.",10627
"Scanner was not good quality through feeder.",10628
"Direct scanner was good.",10629
"It's HUGE.",10630
"just really big for home office.",10631
"Nice printer for the money with all the functions it has.",10632
"Just a bit slow and is always recycling itself after a heavy print load",10633
"Good buy - Set up was a bit complicated but works well and printouts are crisp",10634
"just ok - I bought this printer at the suggestion of a Geek Squad Technician.",10635
"It is an ok printer, but slow if you need multiple printing of different projects.",10636
"It ""wirls and growls for at least 1 minute between projects.",10637
"I had to print 3 envelopes and after typing in each address, it took at least a minute for the printer to respond.",10638
"Going to see about exchanging it.",10639
"If you can get past the fact that this is huge it's a great printer good quality pictures double sided printing",10640
"This printer has seemed like it was slower than the Canon PIXMA MX722 that it replaced.",10641
"Recently, it took the printer over 5 minutes to begin printing a single page document.",10642
"I really liked the MX722 and the fact that I could replace the individual ink cartridges.",10643
"And, I could do so inexpensively buying on eBay.",10644
"However, this printer is really starting to make me regret that I bought it.",10645
"As it says above, the print quality is great.",10646
"My girlfriend uses this to print out photos that she's taken for her portfolio.",10647
"The printer itself uses a lot of ink to maintain/clean itself though, using more ink than others.",10648
"Bought this two months ago and am happy with it so far.",10649
"It had the features that I wanted, including ability to print on CD/DVDs.",10650
"In the first few days there were a couple of times that it reported being out of paper when it wasn't, but that hasn't happened again since then.",10651
"I had a bit of trouble figuring out how to connect it to my wifi network, but finally realized there were hidden options in the installation menu that I had to scroll through to find the one I wanted.",10652
"Still using the original ink cartridges that came with the printer.",10653
"More complicated than necessary - Set up process is too long and complicated but the technical support is excellent.",10654
"This printer replaces the Canon PIXMA I had for five years (my husband bought his the same day and his is still working well, but I used mine much more often).",10655
"This model has more features like double side printing and multi-type and paper size handling.",10656
"It's a little noisier, but thst's.no big deal in the scheme of things.",10657
"I'm satisfied with the quality of this product.",10658
"Liking it so far. - Family seems to like this so far.",10659
"We seem to have a significant number of paper jams but we are trying different paper.",10660
"I'm very pleased with this printer, although it's a bit noisy.",10661
"What has been super great, is the US based tech support offered by Canon!",10662
"Since I've owned this printer, I've contacted them twice -- once during setting up the unit, and another time when the print function wasn't working for a PDF file.",10663
"Both times, a very personable tech ""walked me through"" the steps I needed to take to resolve my issues.",10664
"Our older earlier version of this printer we liked in one way better.",10665
"It had all the same multiple functions, but, I could just print pics on regular copy paper.",10666
"I must use only certain size printer photo paper or it will not print.",10667
"I use to be able to print screen shots on normal paper, now not.",10668
"It does a lot of moving and shaking to ready itself for print.",10669
"HOWEVER, in saying that we really like Canon quality of the printing, and the great customer and technical support from people here in USA for as long as you own it.",10670
"So, I guess I go get some print paper.",10671
"Good price and on the spot pickup at Customer Service.",10672
"Straightforward setup though some steps could be clearer.",10673
"Initially no hassles until added Bluetooth keyboard then no communication.",10674
"Eventually just hardwired with USB printer cable and works fine.",10675
"Have not tried to print from laptop yet.",10676
"Worked before but not optimistic now.",10677
"Stay tuned.",10678
"Excellent all-in-one printer/scanner/fax/copier - Works well.",10679
"Only negative aspect was the device set up was significantly more complex than the Best Buy salesperson said it would be.",10680
"Also, the device can't handle a legal size document.",10681
"Great printer but setup instructions are useless - Setting this printer up for wireless printing was time consuming since the enclosed and online instructions are useless and misleading and don't try calling Canon because that is just a sales pitch.",10682
"Finally changed settings never mentioned in the instructions and it worked.",10683
"Has been working fine since.",10684
"Will never purchase another Canon product because when I called customer support they tried to tell me the problem was in my computer and that it would cost me $500 to $1000 to fix it.",10685
"Have had several canon products and this one is almost identical to the one its replacing.",10686
"The ink is where it cost you.",10687
"Still have a bunch of ink from the one its replacing, and would have bought a printer that uses the same cartridges.",10688
"No such luck as the purposely change the cartridges so you have to throw the ones you bought away when the printer malfunctions.",10689
"Printer does what it says and did a good job on some photos so far.",10690
"My Mac just connected up all by itself.",10691
"in 10 seconds.",10692
"For my wife's Windows machine, I. had to load the driver, go through a couple of reboots and then it did not work!!!",10693
"That's to be expected from Microsoft I guess.",10694
"Had to uninstall all canon stuff, reboot, re-install, reboot, but I finally got it to work after a couple of hours.",10695
"I would recommend uninstalling all canon stuff on a windows machine before trying to install this one.",10696
"Love my new copier and all the functions!",10697
"I have used it a ton sense I got and works just fine.",10698
"One small thing I would change is after a few minutes if I don't print something it disconnects from internet and I have to reconnect it.",10699
"Wish I would stay connected 24/7!",10700
"Easy to install, getting connected wirelessly was a slight struggle.",10701
"We were able to print test pages.",10702
"After that, the only way we could print was from my husbands cell phone.",10703
"No printing would be accepted from our computer, any other cell phone or iPad.",10704
"It tries to print from the envelope drawer and will not let us change it.",10705
"My husband was able to print 3 items and now it says it is offline when it is not.",10706
"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!",10707
"A little larger than expected but made it work.",10708
"Also a little loud.",10709
"Good product.",10710
"I never got to try this printer because of the problems I had trying to set it up.",10711
"The menu on the printer screen asked me to follow all the steps to complete the setup.",10712
"The second step asked me to remove all the packing material and tapes that came with the printer.",10713
"Even after removing all the material and tapes, I kept getting error message.",10714
"I called Canon Tech Support.",10715
"They could not figure out what was wrong and advised me to return the printer.",10716
"The second printer I got from Best Buy did the same thing.",10717
"The Best Buy's Geeks also were of no help.",10718
"Finally, I ended up returning the second printer also and purchased an Epson model which is working fine.",10719
"I'm rarely in a rush to print which is why the fact that this takes a long time to print the first page not a huge issue.",10720
"The printer is also loud.",10721
"Both significantly slower and louder than the earlier Canon printer it replaced.",10722
"But it works well, connected easily to wifi.",10723
"So it was worth the inexpensive price.",10724
"I do wish it had a smaller footprint,",10725
"Print speed is painfully slow.",10726
"Returned within days of purchase.",10727
"Does the job - Takes a long time to get started, but then moves along quickly.",10728
"This did not connect to my Dell laptop.",10729
"I tried 4 three hours, and downloaded every driver I could bc the cd they give you didn't load.",10730
"If you have a Dell computer, dont buy this",10731
"Great Printer!",10732
"- I bought this to replace my HP...best choice I've made!",10733
"This is my first Canon and it far surpasses the HP's I've owned.",10734
"It's very responsive even when in sleep mode and works great with iOS devices.",10735
"Takes a little longer to copy documents, but minor compared to all the benefits.",10736
"I had the hardest time setting it up.",10737
"I did read the negative reviews and I compared with what i have now,( I am a canon guy), and I took a chance since all the features looked attractive, for example, the cd printing is a very sweet deal to have along with the automatic double sided printing (saves you paper).",10738
"the hardest part was setting up the wireless printing part.",10739
"When you want a print out, you have to turn on your wifi on your computer.",10740
"I realize the ink is very expensive , you can almost buy half a printer with a set of cartridges.",10741
"What can you expect from a $78 printer?",10742
"Printing is very slow.",10743
"Output quality is good.",10744
"The scan software interface is poorly written.",10745
"If you do not scan very much, then you won't mind fighting with the Canon software to name your documents and place them where you want them on your hard drive.",10746
"If you're never in a hurry, then you won't mind it taking a minute or more to print something.",10747
"I took this machine back and got a Brother.",10748
"This is a very good multi function machine from Canon.",10749
"I like that it can do everything without taking up too much space.",10750
"However, scanning a document into a PDF file takes a long time.",10751
"Another thing is that the shiny high gloss plastic that Canon like to use on their machines collects dust like no tomorrow.",10752
"Confusing at first, thank heaven for consultant on phone.",10753
"Setup was easy and the print and copy quality are great.",10754
"Only complaint is it can be a bit slow when first waking up.",10755
"All in all it suits my needs!",10756
"Great printer, but - Great print quality and fast.",10757
"I also like the fact that I am able to directly print onto CDs and DVD.",10758
"One issue I have noticed is that setting onto your home network it has an issue with multiple computers access.",10759
"If you print from one computer and then try to print to another home computer you will get a message stating printer is in use by another machine.",10760
"it will not work unless you manually clear the Print Spooler.",10761
"The price and the print quality makes up for the annoyance.",10762
"So far, I really like this product.",10763
"I was upgrading from an older Canoscan printer/scanner so I expected that I would like it.",10764
"It was very easy to set up wirelessly with all of my devices, including PC, Mac, iPad, and iPhone.",10765
"I really love being able to print pictures so easily from my iPhone or iPad.",10766
"The automatic sheet feeder for scanning and duplex printing work very well.",10767
"There are a few minor things that could be better.",10768
"For some reason the guides for the sheet feeder do not allow you to insert a single envelope so you have to remove the paper from the lower cassette, insert an envelope, and adjust the guides.",10769
"The printer is also pretty noisy, large, and takes a wild to repair itself for printing if you haven't printed in a while.",10770
"Easy setup - Picture quality is bad.",10771
"Very grainy and not very colorful.",10772
"I haven't had it long so I may need to adjust settings somehow.",10773
"This PIXMA replaced my last PIXMA 620.",10774
"Was unable to interface to computer cordlessly, used a HDMI cable world fine.",10775
"Copy, print works well Still unable to Scan",10776
"The printer is replacing an MX870 printer and seems to be very comparable.",10777
"The MX870 had a paper feed at the back for card stock paper that the MX922 does not have and I have had the MX922 fail to feed card stock several times.",10778
"It is not hard to check the paper drawer, and press the OK button to re-try the print, but it is a hassle.",10779
"It's still to be seen how much ink the MX922 uses compared to the MX870.",10780
"Overall, I like the functionality of the MX922 printer.",10781
"A tad slow - It's works properly and does a decent job but it would be nice for it to print faster",10782
"If I could give it a zero I would.",10783
"Had an old pixma that worked for years.",10784
"When it came to buying another copier I bought another canon pixma.",10785
"Returned after my second copy and got another one.",10786
"What are the odds that the same thing would happen again?",10787
"Apparently very high.",10788
"Same exact thing happened after my second copy.",10789
"Error code 1311.",10790
"So I took it back a second time and got something else entirely.",10791
"I really wanted it to work, but canon let me down on this one.",10792
"it's a lot bigger than what I thought - also, the set up wasn't as easy as I thought it was gonna.",10793
"I wouldn't purchase again - but will do for now.",10794
"Had Canon before & was happy with it.",10795
"This one was terrible: loud, slow & bad printing.",10796
"I returned for a Brother & I'm elated!!",10797
"This printer replaced same model that died 3 months after the 2 year extended warranty.",10798
"I purchased same model to allow me to consume the ink cartridges in my stock.",10799
"I wished this model had a single sheet feeder.",10800
"I have always been a fan of CANON printers.",10801
"When my previous MX 922 started giving me error messages which wouldn't go away after changing the cartridges, considering it had given me fault-free good quality service (copying and printing) for about 4 years, I decided to get a replacement.",10802
"It recognized my Wifi easily and has been doing print jobs very well.",10803
"One issue some people may have with this printer is the time it takes sometimes to get the cartridges ready in between jobs.",10804
"efficient - Big drawback is the noise it makes when starting a print.",10805
"Nice looking but bulky.",10806
"Print is good.",10807
"This printer does everything I want and more.",10808
"Very easy to use, simple to print from my mobile devices.",10809
"Only drawback is size.",10810
"It is very large and heavy.",10811
"This printer has been great so far.",10812
"Set up was a bit tricky, but follow the directions and you'll be fine.",10813
"Photo's so far have been very nice, and the print time is very fast.",10814
"I like that the front cover pops down to catch the paper coming out on it's own.",10815
"That's a nice feature.",10816
"Downside is that this is a fairly large printer, but not overly large that it's annoying.",10817
"My first printer in 2000 was a Canon and it made beautiful color pictures and clear/precise documents.",10818
"Since then I've had 2 HP printers and an Epson printer.",10819
"None of these other brands have printed to the same precision that my old Canon did.",10820
"So this time I went back to a Canon and I am VERY pleased.",10821
"My pictures are gorgeous (something I've missed and am glad to have back again) and my documents are nice and clear.",10822
"Hard to believe that this little Canon printer does better than my 3 more expensive HP & Epson printers did even when they were new.",10823
"I'm quite happy with my little Canon.",10824
"Pros: had the highest resolution for ink jet printers.",10825
"Scanning and copy work well.",10826
"Con: a bit slower on the overall print process and rather large footprint.",10827
"It took a bit to set up.",10828
"And of course, the ink is too expensive.",10829
"I bought this to replace another MX922.",10830
"The printer head was shot.",10831
"I shopped for a newer unit, but newer units with all the bells and whistles of this all-in-one were much more expensive.",10832
"I only gave it a 3 because of the short life of the printer head but lots of features.",10833
"Hope this one lasts longer.",10834
"I do the this printer.",10835
"It prints documents and photos well.",10836
"I deduced a star for the large footprint...",10837
"this thing is big!",10838
"Didn't work out the box - Purchased this printer for my classroom.",10839
"Sadly it didn't work out the box.",10840
"The ink cartridges couldn't align.",10841
"Thankfully Best Buy allowed me to return it even though I was 1 day past the 15 day return period.",10842
"This printer does everything, works well, fairly easy to set up, however its somewhat slow to start printing (wirelessly).",10843
"Absolute P.O.S. I like far too many, I have become a victim of the notorious ""B200"" error code.",10844
"This error code renders the printer completely useless and once this code strikes, you are left with only two options - contact Canon and pay for service and parts or buy a new printer.",10845
"No printer is safe from this problem.",10846
"What a total scam.",10847
"I have chosen to replace my printer with a different brand and will never buy anything from Canon again.",10848
"I am posting information about this everywhere I can and encouraging everyone I know, to avoid any Canon printer - this includes the 1200+ people in my work network.",10849
"To the people of Canon - I give you the finger!",10850
"Hi colleen7, Some noises prior to printing are normal, especially the first print after turning the printer on.",10851

"Well, this Canon was a bit quieter, but it started ""acting up"" after less than 3 months of use, when it officially stopped scanning.",14371
"Sometimes it would still print but the display screen was super fuzzy and upside down.",14372
"So, I decided to return it.",14373
"I couldn't find my receipt but Best Buy was able to find it through my rewards number, which made the return really easy.",14374
"I went back to HP.",14375
"Very please with Best Buy customer service!",14376
"Awesome printer!",14377
"- I used to be a loyal Epson printer person, but Canon blows Epson out of the water.",14378
"This is my 2nd Canon printer, and the only reason I retired my other one (mx860, gave it to my daughter...it's still running strong after 3 years) is because I wanted the wireless printing for my ipad and phone.",14379
"I was in a hurry the day I set it up, so I called Canon's awesome tech support and they had me up and running and fully set up in no time.",14380
"Love this printer and would buy it again!",14381
"Will have to grow into this!",14382
"- Lots of features, great print quality.",14383
"Does make a bit of noise",14384
"so far good - I had to return 1St because fax stopped working so far going well",14385
"Currently best Canon All-in-One Inject - Purchased as a replacement for Canon Pixma MX860, this was an easy transition.",14386
"Indeed, it works just as well, if not better than the 860, and has a number of improvements.",14387
"Gone is the ""pop-out"" rear tray for photo printing, etc. A new, second tray loaded from the front allows easy storage of photo paper at the same time regular paper is stored.",14388
"The fully wireless network install was a snap, and not having it wired to any one computer in the house has been a blessing.",14389
"If I had to list one thing I didn't like, the Canon included software is a pain.",14390
"It's NOT intuitive, it's based on the assumption that you want to ""make things"" (Calendars, mugs, etc.) rather than print school work, etc. I could do without it, as it's anything but intuitive.",14391
"First time I scanned a photo, I had *NO IDEA* where it was stored, what it was called, etc.",14392
"But the Scanning was great, the printing is great.",14393
"Good printer at an *EXCELLENT* price.",14394
"Does it's job - The printer does everything it is supposed.",14395
"If there is any downside it is the size (pretty large) and the speed (printing is pretty slow).",14396
"Other than that I am happy with my purchase, everything works well and has quality.",14397
"Ok printer - The printer works fine however it takes a long time to print color pages but once it does one the others speed up.",14398
"Only bought this printer for color copies for small usage so it fills the bill and price.",14399
"Slow but good quality - This is our 2nd one. 1st one lasted 2 years before print head went bad.",14400
"Unfortunately we had just bought a lot of ink cartridges so we decided to get another one.",14401
"As others have said this printer takes forever to get started but the print quality is good for our needs.",14402
"We are now in a world of disposable products and we only only hope for another 2 years but the price point is not bad for the features.",14403
"Good for printing CD/DVDs - The main reason I chose this printer, other than price, was that I needed to replace one that died, and had the capability to print on CD/DVDs.",14404
"There are two things that this printer doesn't have that my prior Canon had: 1-Rear feed capability to allow you to print on greeting card stock.",14405
"The specs say that the maximum weight paper it can handle is 25#.",14406
"2-The rear feed slot on the old canon printer could handle widths down to 2-3/4"" which allows me to print on checks.",14407
"Both trays can only go down as far as 3-1/4"".wide.",14408
"Looks good. - This printer does everything.",14409
"I haven't tried it all, but I think it's a good all around computer.",14410
"It's a little bigger than I thought, but it's ok for a family's printer.",14411
"I like the stealth black color of it too.",14412
"Copy quality is good - I bought the MX922 to replace my old MX340.",14413
"The copy quality is good but it is bigger, slower and makes loud clunky noises.",14414
"I liked my old one much better.",14415
"A great printer - I have had HP printers in the past, but this Canon is far superior to any previous printer.",14416
"It is fast, easy to set up, prints online or via my iPhone and iPad, and two-sided printing saves a lot of paper.",14417
"Recommend this very highly!",14418
"Adequate - I've not had the printer long enough to make an informed review, just responding to Best Buy.",14419
"I've not configured the wireless, I'm running on cable.",14420
"My first impression, printing from standby seems to be a little lengthy, maybe maintenance is meant to prolong usage.",14421
"However, this is replacing an HP that I've had for about 8 years using a sub to Ethernet dongle.",14422
"I thought the footprint was a little large.",14423
"But consumer reports gave it a good review.",14424
"clear but slow. - A nice and clear printer but it has a slow start up.",14425
"Garbage - Canon's printers have been steadily getting worse and at this point I'm not sure why I keep buying them.",14426
"This one frequently loses connection to the wi-fi access point even though our other devices right next to it work fine.",14427
"If you try it with a USB cable, half the time it won't print and won't relay any errors.",14428
"Combine that with the fact that the cartridge carriage is stuck this morning and maintenance won't run or throw any exceptions.",14429
"So now I want to go full Office Space on this terrible printer because I'm past the return date.",14430
"MX922 - I had very good luck with my previous Canon printer (MP470) so I figure I'd give this one a shot.",14431
"So far, so good.",14432
"The only thing that is kind of annoying is the paper trays underneath the output tray.",14433
"I also had an issue with one of the ink tanks not being recognized by the printer..",14434
"I contacted Canon and they had me check a few things then sent me a replacement tank.",14435
"Printed a couple pictures out with the sample pack of 4x6 glossy photo paper and was pretty impressed.",14436
"Something you may not be aware of if you have not seen this AIO in person is that it is quite large.",14437
"Great All-In-One - I bought this on a recommendation from a tech-savvy friend.",14438
"His only specs were Canon and at least one step above the least expensive.",14439
"I found this one on sale and jumped on it.",14440
"It works fantastic.",14441
"My only complaint is it doesn't hold an entire ream of paper.",14442
"The ink that came with it seem to be the same as the set I bought at time of purchase.",14443
"nice printer - Nice full function printer.",14444
"A little bigger footprint than I expected but OK.",14445
"Good all around printer for college student for lees than $100.",14446
"Excellent quality printer - I have had the printer for about one month and it has performed better than I anticipated.",14447
"I have had other ink jet printers over the past 15 years but the Canon performs better than most.",14448
"It is a little slow when beginning to print but is tolerable and does as excellent job.",14449
"The replacement ink cartridges are expensive however.",14450
"Nice mid level printer - Printer works well and has the feel of a more expensive printer.",14451
"However, it does seem take a little while to warm up before it prints.",14452
"Good but a bit slow - This printer is good, but it takes a lot of time to turn on",14453
"somewhat complicated to operate, great results - set up was somewhat complicated especially the insertion of paper.",14454
"The operation was smooth and flawless.",14455
"Results were terrific.",14456
"Great printer!",14457
"- Although it might seem complicated at first if you're not used to All-in-one printers, it's pretty straightforward.",14458
"Clear instructions but missing bits, tiny pieces or details that might come in handy.",14459
"Couldn't get mine to start working because of a misunderstanding with the paper trays.",14460
"But, as a printer, it's an excellent one.",14461
"Great prints - It does great job of printing.",14462
"Little slow processing photo but when it starts printing its quick.",14463
"great product - Easy set up works great.",14464
"Just waiting to see if aftermarket ink works, Threw out my HP because the only work with store bought HP ink.",14465
"SUPER INVESTMENT CD/DVD LABEL PINTER IS GREAT - HAD IT FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS THE CD/DVD LABEL SOFTWARE THAT CAME WITH THE PRINTER WAS VERY POOR I WAS READY TO RETURN IT BUT CALLED CANON AND THEY DOWNLOADED SOME GREAT SOFTWARE VERY HAPPY NOW CANON TECH. SUPPORT WAS SUPER.",14466
"IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A INK JET LABEL PRINTER THIS ONE IS WILL DO IT FOR YOU VERY EASY TO SET UP AND USE.",14467
"I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND IT.",14468
"Low cost, easy set up!",14469
"- The MX 922 is fairly inexpensive but seems very reliable with an easy set up.",14470
"Since Canon makes it impossible to use ink cartridges that you have on hand from a previous unit, I have decided to never invest in a more expensive printer.",14471
"The blacks are rich and the colors are fairly accurate with this unit.",14472
"Good Features - I like this printer but it seems to have issues with printing it appears not to be on the network.",14473
"I must admit it is huge but I decided to keep it anyway, I also think the ink is costly but I try to recycle cartridges when purchasing new ones.",14474
"I love that I can print from my devices also.",14475
"Good, versatile printer, although not super fast. - I bought this printer because it had an amazing discount.",14476
"Overall, it's been a great printer.",14477
"The print quality is very good, and the additional scanning and copying functionality is excellent.",14478
"I love being able to send print jobs via wifi.",14479
"However, it is not the fastest printer, though, as a print job of about 25 pages has ended up taking a lot of time (probably 8-15 minutes) to complete.",14480
"awful for cloud printing - Don't know if it's googles fault or canon, hate it",14481
"can't beat the price - The setup was not too difficult but having trouble receiving fax.",14482
"Wasted money - Haven't even had this printer 2 months and it's screwed up already!",14483
"It started not responding for about 4 minutes after being given a print command, then printing part of a page and stopping for a minute, then finishing the partial page and starting page 2, stopping etc.",14484
"Takes 5 minutes plus to print 4 pages!",14485
"Good all in one Unit - Pretty large for an all in one unit.",14486
"The print speed could be better even when selecting ""express"" or B&W mode to allow for quicker printing.",14487
"The paper tray that always pops open when printing is a bit annoying as it always needs to be manually closed.",14488
"I do like the wireless printing capability even though I have mine hard wired and not wireless.",14489
"Overall a good product with decent scanning speed.",14490
"So far so good after 2 months. - All functions work fine.",14491
"I'm having a little trouble setting up the fax to receive (with answering machine) but that's very minor at this point for me.",14492
"I haven't called support yet but I'm sure once I spend the time to go through the options I'll get it figured out.",14493
"On the initial start-up it does take it a little while to get situated before it start to print (copy, scan or fax).",14494
"And it is a little noisy during this even on quiet mode but nothing I can't deal with.",14495
"I haven't had enough time to judge the ink consumption.",14496
"Time will tell on this but I'm keeping my hopes up.",14497
"Overall I'm pleased with the purchase.",14498
"Good machine but.... - I like the printer.",14499
"I like the separate ink cartridges.",14500
"I do believe the machine is built cheaply, therefore, buy the extended warranty.",14501
"This is my 3rd Canon MX 922, this last one was replaced free.",14502
"not favorable - Takes to long to process function request often duplicate s unnecessary copies.",14503

"It is also incredibly slow!",15616
"I can't imagine anyone using this at work when you have time constraints.",15617
"Don't buy!",15618
"- I've been trying for months to keep this printer on line-piece of junk!",15619
"Now I can't return it!",15620
"Out of box failure.",15621
"The printer didn't work and had to be returned for a full refund.",15622
"After only 2 months, it wouldn't print anymore.",15623
"I think one of the sensors broke because it kept telling me the lower paper tray (Regular 8 x 11"") needed paper when it was already full.",15624
"I tried turning off and on, reloading and realigning multiple times.",15625
"It seemed like the most amazing printer in the world when I got it but quickly started giving me problems.",15626
"This is the second Canon Printer I've bought.",15627
"I love the quality of the results.",15628
"I needed some tech support and I easily got it.",15629
"Fixed my problem and I've had no issues since.",15630
"I learned that a Google Chromebook will not wake it from sleep mode.",15631
"No problems with it waking up from my IPad or my desktop.",15632
"Perhaps the next one will have improved the issue with Chromebook.",15633
"Four Stars - works fine but not quiet",15634
"I bought the MX922 to replace a Canon MX870 that fell prey to a printer cartridge issue common to that model.",15635
"Given how cheap inkjet printers are (they make their profits on the cartridges), I figured I'd get a newer model that supported printing from our iPhones and iPads.",15636
"Overall, the MX922 operates as well as the MX870 did.",15637
"However, it only operates at the 2.4 ghz WiFi frequency.",15638
"It doesn't support 5.0 ghz, which is the faster, longer-range frequency available on newer routers.",15639
"I had to dumb down all the other devices on our network to share this printer.",15640
"There may be some work around to use it on the higher frequency, but it won't do it out of the box and I don't have the tech skills to figure it out.",15641
"So if your WiFi network operates at 2.4 ghz, its a good printer.",15642
"But check before you buy to make sure that you're not on 5.0.",15643
"Seems to be a quality printer just having trouble figuring out the fax- Prints well.",15644
"I had purchased this printer trusting the reviews as I do with all my other purchases on Amazon.",15645
"I have had this printer for under 6 months and rarely am able to use it because it works when it wants.",15646
"I have read the manual many times and tried figuring out why ""airprint"" does not work on this printer.",15647
"That was the whole purpose of me buying this printer to be able to print from my phone and or laptop using wifi connectivity.",15648
"I looked online to see if anyone else is having the same issue and sure enough there are a flood of complaints with the same issue.",15649
"I am constantly asking my neighbors to use their printer for school work which is unacceptable.",15650
"I am not one to write bad reviews but the frustration is real since I contacted Amazon support and no one reached back out to me to help.",15651
"Also it is ridiculously heavy, I would say go with hp.",15652
"I had my old HP printer for over 7 years not a single issue.",15653
"Good printer but very bulky and slow - Good printer but very bulky and slow.",15654
"I like the fact that it uses individual cartridges to minimize ink waste.",15655
"Doesn't work for even a year...",15656
"* * * DON'T PURCHASE * * * - I bought this printer in January 2017 because of the reviews.",15657

"Scans and faxes without issues.",15665
"Application download is an added benefit.",15666
"Printing problems can be solved...good printer all in all - I am going back and forth on whether to call this a 3 star or 4 star machine, I settled on 4 because ultimately for the price, my main problem can be fixed.",15667
"This is my second Pixma printer and I didn't find out until I purchased this one why I had problems with the first one.",15668
"I don't use my printer often, sometimes going weeks between use.",15669
"So as I looked through reviews I saw some saying this is junk with light use, and I would agree because the print head does gum up and dry out if the printer is not used regularly.",15670
"It requires removal of the print head and cleaning with warm running water to clear it out (which Canon does not recommend).",15671
"But it can be done easily enough, and only takes about 5 minutes once you figure out how to do it, you can find YouTube videos that give step by step instruction.",15672
"I always run a print head alignment after removing the print head, as well as another basic cleaning cycle, then the printer comes back to life.",15673
"It is frustrating, but all in all what can you expect for less than $100?",15674
"Based on the price of this printer and the quality of photo printing that you can get, it really is a good printer.",15675
"If its not a camera, AVOID CANON - I waste an incredible amount of time regularly nursing this printer, jumping through troubleshooting hoops, to get this damn printer to work.",15676
"Infuriating device.",15677
"Works well but a tiny bit slow especially with pictures. - I like this printer, it's affordable, easy to use, works well, and the ink is affordable.",15678
"My only complaint is that the printer is quite slow.",15679
"When it prints, it's great. - This printer was purchased because I wanted an airprint device, a printer that had good quality, and something that would print from all our workstations.",15680
"I hate to say it, but this printer is a true pain.",15681
"STANDBY MODE: When it goes in standby mode, printing to it does not wake it up and none of us can airprint to it.",15682
"It often requires turning off and back on to get it to recognize somebody wants to print to it.",15683
"AIRPRINT Isn't one of the main points of airprint, is to be somewhere else in the house and print something using a phone or tablet?",15684
"And then at your leisure go grab what you printed.",15685
"I would have to say I have been successful about 10% of the time getting any phone or tablet to find the airprint device.",15686
"WIFI Connection: I wanted a printer that would handle all the printing from the various computers we have.",15687
"Unfortunately, you can never count on it being connected to wifi, even though the modem/wifi is less than 4 feet from it.",15688
"We have to reset the connect at least once a month and that's annoying.",15689
"Positive side: It really does print lovely prints when it prints.",15690
"mehh probably better ones on the market - its a nice little printer but sometimes it just takes a very long time to queue a job to print.",15691
"Missing very useful feature: I switched from Epson.",15692
"When you were scanning something (to be saved as PDF) I would get ""Add Page""or ""Save File""option.",15693
"It would allow me to keep adding scans to same file saving it PDF after, say, 5 scans.",15694
"Canon has the ability to save multiple pages in one PDF but you cannot use individual scans (without feeder) saving them all into one PDF.",15695
"This is such a bummer.",15696
"If I am scanning receipts from a trip to be saved/sent to my employer I cannot scan them all saving them into one file.",15697
"These are not documents but receipts, so I must scan them individually, and Canon utility saves them as individual PDF files.",15698
"Big annoyance",15699
"Brand new Printer cycles through error 6000 & 6001 (internal hardware error).",15700
"After an hour of fiddling and support phone call I'm getting a ""replacement"" printer, but I have to remove parts from the non-functional printer to make the ""replacement"" work.",15701
"Given the number of people with the same problem I've seen after a web search canon has a manufacturing defect in the printer and if you buy one you will have to send it back and get someone else's returned printer that they've *hopefully* fixed the defect on.",15702
"So if you want to pay full price for a remanufactured printer buy this, but if you want a NEW printer buy something else.",15703
"This printer is somehow slower and more problematic than printers were 10 years ago.",15704
"It takes 4EVER to warm up, if paper runs out, it takes 4EVER to print once loaded, everything moves super slow.",15705
"The print quality is good, but it takes a god damn miracle for it to print",15706
"JUNK - Have had for just over one year and have nothing but problems with it.",15707
"HP will be the only printers I buy from now on.",15708

"Don't waste your money!",15710
"If I could return it, I would!",15711

"I've had three Canon printers solely due to the fact that I like to print on DVD's.",15713
"Each of them clogged up in such a manner that the stopped printing.",15714
"Not a mechanical issue, a ink turns into solid mass issue.",15715
"No amount of deep cleaning fixes the problem.",15716
"A great printer in every other respect but if you live in a dry climate you'll end up throwing it away within a year.",15717
"but it works well and is a great price. - Kind of noisy, but it works well and is a great price.",15718
"Waste of time - Complete garbage.",15719

"Such a headache not even funny anymore",15721
"Good price, but the fax died about 9 months after I bought it.",15722
"Trying to get support for this now.",15723
"Not the most user friendly to set up with a LAN either.",15724
"But print quality is decent and very inexpensive print cartridges available for this.",15725
"Should have read the reviews before this purchase.",15726
"Very poor compatibility with Mac, iPhones and Apple products.",15727
"Despite reading online solutions and updating the drivers, I cannot get air print to work.",15728

"Besides that very annoying thing, it's a nice printer.",15730
"It takes what seems like an eternity to start printing after I click ""print"" ... - This printer drives me nuts!",15731
"It takes what seems like an eternity to start printing after I click ""print"" on my computer.",15732
"It goes through a long 45 second processing program before it even begins to print.",15733
"What a joke!",15734
"I had a 6-year old Lexmark printer before this and it printed almost immediately and at a faster speed than this dog.",15735
"AND if that is not enough...after it completes printing the document it goes through another crazy 45 second noisy processing program.",15736
"WTF!",15737
"Canon must have a good reason for this but I've never experienced this on any printer previously.",15738
"In addition, the door makes a startling noise when it automatically drops down for printing.",15739
"The plastic door hinge broke so printed docs end up on the floor.",15740
"I had to call Canon and they shipped me a refurbished printer replacement.",15741
"Ink usage is ridiculous.",15742
"I estimate that I got 2-3x more printed pages from my Lexmark cartridges!",15743
"I'm not keeping this crappy printer for very long.",15744
"I want peace!",15745
"Four Stars - Overall unit is fine it's just a very long time for it to process something to print",15746
"Aweful quality.",15747
"There is even a typo on the ... - Aweful quality.",15748
"There is even a typo on the setup screen built in to the firmware.",15749
"They couldn't even bother to proof read; that's how much effort they put in to this product.",15750
"A single print head for this model is already 90$ or something like that. - Does the job well.",15751
"Uses a lot of ink.",15752
"Sensitive parts.",15753
"Can't beat the price.",15754
"A single print head for this model is already 90$ or something like that.",15755
"I have had it with this printer for 3 reasons: 1.",15756

"2.",15759
"When your ink is out, IT'S OUT.",15760
"You cannot even choose to print all black if one of the colored ones is out.",15761
"I print mostly in black, I find this quite annoying.",15762
"It will STOP and will not let you continue at all until you replace it.",15763
"3.",15764
"Sometimes it decides to ""do it's thing"" in between printing.",15765
"It seems like it has to reboot or something, goes thru a process that takes several minutes and when you just want your one copy, it seems like forever.",15766
"I have really liked Canon before, but this one bites, had this one for about 5 months.",15767
"Copies are good, just have to go through too much.",15768
"Four Stars - Slow but does the job.",15769
"I'm disappointed. - It doesn't stay connected to wifi very well.",15770
"I'm disappointed.",15771

"It was easy to print from phones and tabs.",15775
"It only lasted 2years 2 months with minimal home use.",15776
"I had really hoped for a couple more years of use.",15777
"It is wasteful and expensive to have to rebuy electronics every 2 years.",15778
"The parts are overly expensive in relation to buying a new one.",15779
"I'm not sure if I will get this one again or a different brand.",15780
"My last Canon printer did the same thing after about 2 years.",15781
"Do the darn things have a kill switch?",15782
"I really dislike adding more junk to landfills or having to require more things than needed be processed as recycled.",15783
"I had an older version of this printer that was fantastic, but I wanted an air print.",15784
"In my opinion a printer should be user friendly and just work, sadly this one wants my attention way too much, in fact I am writing this review while I wait for on online receipt to print; NOT EVEN HALF A PAGE in black and white AND I am still waiting.",15785
"Sure there is probably some fix, but I am annoyed that it seems like I have to always find some kind of fix for this machine.",15786
"I do not recommend.",15787
"Do not get me wrong I think Canon is a fine company but this printer is a lemon!",15788
"Hope this helps",15789
"Printer is great wifi is not. - The printer itself works great.",15790
"This is actually my second one.",15791
"My first one died after about 3.5 years of very heavy business use.",15792
"The issue I have with the unit is that wifi never works.",15793
"It didn't work on my first unit and it doesn't work on this one.",15794
"Oh, it does work each time you set it up and then just randomly stops until you hook it up again.",15795
"Other than the wifi the printer is great.",15796
"And I work right next to the machine so its not like my wifi is 4 rooms away.",15797
"Ok, if it doesn't die - This printer was pretty decent for the price, but after 4 years of very light use (less than 100 pages a year), it died for no apparent reason.",15798
"I powered it on today and it now states that ""Type of print head in incorrect.",15799
"Install correct print head (Error 1403)"".",15800
"Ok...that seems sketchy, since I had absolutely no issues with it the last time I printed.",15801
"I even swapped the ink cartridges out with some spares, reset the printer, and reseated the print head.",15802
"To add insult to injury, I can't even use the scanner, since it won't boot to the main screen.",15803
"A replacement print head costs as much as the entire printer, so I guess I'm shopping for a new one now, which I really loathe, since I HATE filling up landfills with garbage because of a single bad component.",15804
"I feel like a Sucker for spending so much on this printer. - Well at least we got over 2 years out of this piece of junk before it completely crapped out.",15805
"What an expensive hunk of junk that was always very hard to run, set-up (constantly), and maintain.",15806
"Love this printer!",15807
"- I bought this to replace an HP all in one and I am thrilled with this purchase.",15808
"The ink was ridiculous priced for the HP and there are much cheaper options for ink for the Canon.",15809
"The print quality is amazing.",15810
"Definitely recommend.",15811
"Dying on the vine. - Purchase this printer in March of this year.",15812
"Started out printing normal.",15813
"But now, it is jamming the paper inside the machine about every ten pages, double printing over the lower part of some of the sheets, and only printing partially on others.",15814
"Warranty says I have to send the machine back to the manufacturer for evaluation, and maybe they will honor the warranty.",15815
"In the mean time, I will be without a printer, for weeks/months.",15816
"So I will not return it and instead buy a decent HP printer.",15817
"I spent along time looking at printers before I decided to pull the trigger on this MX922.",15818
"It was a hard decision with some of the negative reviews or issues people have reported.",15819
"I have been using it for about a month now and am pretty satisfied.",15820
"Below are a few pro's/con's/tips based on other reviews.",15821
"For home office use, I think this is a great printer.",15822
"If you are running a small business or a school etc where many people are going to be complaining to an IT guy for ever nuance, I would find something else.",15823
"Pros 1) High function printer, and all of the features work 2) Cheap ink available 3) The printer is cheap in its market Cons 1) Its a big unit, I came from an epson with the same feature set and it was quite a bit smaller in size 2) Many of the parts and actions 'feel' cheap, however they seem to be pretty well built 3) It is a bit finicky, sometimes you have to restart your PC in order to pick it up if its been turned off etc. 4) It does seem to go through ink faster than my epson Tips 1) The printer is set to a higher quality print 'default'.",15824
"This means that the printer will clean the head before ever print if its been more than about 1 min between prints.",15825
"This uses up tons of ink.",15826
"So, go into your printer settings on the PC and set it to default to draft.",15827
"For normal printing this will still look fine but will speed up the 'warm up time' as well as save you ink.",15828
"2) If you are printing in black and white only, set your print settings to monochrome.",15829
"If you dont, while you see black the printer will still use some color to make it perfect to the print.",15830
"By setting it to monochrome it will only print black which will use up your larger black cartridge.",15831
"3) People have said things about the wireless but I have not had an issue.",15832
"The printer is on 2.4mhz channel and devices wired, on 2.4, and on 5ghz all connect with no issue.",15833
"If you are having an issue with this its likely a router issue as everything is on the same LAN.",15834
"WORST PRINTER EVER!",15835
"- Never worked properly!",15836
"kept feeding it ink but connectivity never worked.",15837
"Forced to buy a new one.",15838
"Will never by Canon product again.",15839
"It is a very, very slow printer.",15840
"I use the app from my phone and it takes a while to print one page and then it gets jam or there is always an error when is more than one page, plus the ink dont last long.",15841
"Remember that you get what you pay for.",15842
"This is the third printer I've owned and is by far the worst of the three.",15843
"It eats through ink like nobodies business, it uses up my colored ink, even when I only print in black and white, and just recently it stopped printing altogether; it will suck up printer paper and then spit it out with nothing on it.",15844
"Seriously, wtf?",15845
"For something so expensive, I shouldn't have such a hard time getting it to do its basic function.",15846
"Truly, you will spend more time troubleshooting this thing than you will printing pages.",15847
"One Star - error code from start, no help from canon told me to return it.",15848
"second one ok.",15849
"I have had two of these printers and both broke after about 18 months related to something with the print head.",15850
"So I thought, why don't I get away from this printer and go with another brand that has to have: Scan capabilities and Duplex printing.",15851
"I do a lot of printing and wanted to get the most bang for my buck.",15852
"I went back and looked at all the generic ink I had purchased since I bought my last one and it totaled 58 ink cartridges.",15853
"I then multiple that by the cost, and divided by 18 to get a per month cost based upon generic ink.",15854
"I then looked at the HP 5420 and the Epson WF-2760 to see how they compared.",15855
"I looked up the generic cost for each ink cartridge they used and calculated the same monthly cost for each assuming the same number pages printed per cartridge. (which by both Epson (450) and HP (480) print less number of pages than Canon (500)).",15856
"Base upon MY usage HP month cost came to $32/month and Epson came in at $22/month and Canon with $16/month.",15857
"Then I asked two questions.",15858
"What would be more cost effective if I had to buy a new printer each year and/or if the printer lasted 5 years?",15859
"In both instances the cost of ownership favored Canon.",15860
"Brand 1 Year 5 Year Canon $283 $1056 Epson $340 $1423 HP $454 $2033 I would say we print on average 1000 pages a month.",15861
"So even though the printer does not last as long as I would hope, I'm giving it 5 stars because overall I have been very satisfied with the printer and the cost of ownership is much lower in the long run no matter how I look at it.",15862
"I love this printer so much more than my old HP.",15863
"It is so economical on ink.",15864
"With my HP, I had to buy ink every time I turned around.",15865
"Not so with the Canon.",15866
"I love it!",15867
"Less than 2 years old and started getting ""Error 6000"" code.",15868
"Due to urgency, went out and bought a replacement unit at local store.",15869
"Within 2 days got the same ""Error 6000"" code.",15870
"Reading the Canon forums, this appears to be an issue that a lot of customers are facing particularly with new units.",15871
"Good but not great - Good print quality but it takes FOREVER to boot into ready to print mode.",15872
"The interface is old hat.",15873
"It died in less than two years (error code B200) and local authorized service center won't fix.",15874
"They said they only fix laser printers and Canon does not fix inkjet printer either.",15875
"What a waste of money.",15876
"Make better products Canon.",15877
"The printer is OK but the email printing option is pathetic when compared to the similar HP feature.",15878
"HP will print any email with photos, text etc.",15879
"Canon will only print jpgs and pdfs.",15880
"No email text, docs, or xls.",15881
"I would have bought the much cheaper HP had I known, This can be fixed by Canon in fact they could make it even better than HP.",15882
"Bought to replace MX882 - Bought this to replace an MX882.",15883
"Seems to print well and faster.",15884
"Only gripe is that it doesn't use the same print cartridges as the MX882.",15885
"So far pleased.",15886
"One Star - machine gave error after 4 month of use.",15887
"Good quality output - Great quality, start up is a little slow.",15888

"- What a useless POS ...",15891
"Loses wireless connection randomly - States paper tray is empty when it is full - Goes ""Offline"" for no reason at all - Takes forever to print - Hogs ink - Totally unreliable - Avoid this piece of crap if you need to rely on your printer!",15892

"Don't think you are going to print out anything in a hurry and dash out the door.",15894
"You will either be late or give up.",15895
"I have made very few copies because it is such a pain to use this thing, and the very expensive ink cartridge is almost out of ink.",15896
"MX922 = B200 error code - Wish I never bought this, nothing but trouble.",15897
"Just got another B200 error code this is my last B200 error code going back to HP never had as much trouble with them as I have with canon.",15898
"All I can say is this is my first and last canon printer.",15899
"Too Big for My Space - This printer was so big and ""moosey"" that I sent it back.",15900
"I have a home office and it was just too big.",15901
"It was also more complicated than I needed...or wanted.",15902

"That's probably being generous.",16164
"While it did run as well as advertised for a time--maybe as long as a whole year, it wasn't miraculous: it went through ink fairly quickly, and more and more it seems to obsess over cleaning the printer head every time given a job.",16165
"It wasn't long you could expect the initial loud, grinding cleaning process to take five times as long as your average 1 to 3 page printing job.",16166
"That'd be more forgivable if it actually seemed effective, except it didn't: in less than a year, a lot of black printing came off increasingly jagged and staggered-looking, the sign of a specific head being dirty (the others were unaffected, probably due to lack of use).",16167
"Without previous experience, cleaning it was expensive, and that was after using up a cartridge with the seemingly useless self-cleaning feature.",16168

"you then are offered the option of saving the doc or adding more pages.",19018
"another nice feature is that i can leave the output cover closed w/o having to worry about remembering to open it when needed (i have a cat who enjoys the ambient heat & likes to sleep on the top, which can cause a hair clog problem) - as soon as you request to print or copy, the output door opens & the extension to keep the paper from winging off the end extends.",19019

"Another issue that just shows the lack of care that was put into the production of this boat anchor is the grammar used in the system messages that come up on the cheap little screen, which are obviously bad translations from a foreign language.",19218
"Also, replacing cartridges is ergonomically challenged, with little tactile feedback to let you know you did it correctly.",19219
"This is probably engineered in so that more damage is done to the flimsy carriage when replacing the cartridges.",19220
